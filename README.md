# ParrotAI

ParrotAI is a text generation platfrom that seeks to help everyone write better, faster and most importantly, affordably.

The application is written in PHP, it uses MySQL (or MariaDB) as data storage back-end and has a simple but intuitive user interface.

Currently the application uses commercial APIs by GooseAI and OpenAI. It was inspired by EleutherAI's 6b.eleuther.ai where the developer 
first made calls to the publicly exposed and unauthenticated endpoint.

At the moment, users can generate (expand) and paraphrase text (to some extent) based on a prompt.

The developer is working to add more features such as support for writing product descriptions, emails, blog titles etc, as seen in more mainstream applications.
