                    <p>After trying out all the other AI writing tools (Jarvis etc.), I stumbled upon ParrotAI. And I'm glad I did. It's helped me double my writing output myself, and I'm training my writing team to use it as well. Took less than a month for me to recover my investment in the LTD - absolutely worth it. And Kelvin is one of the best developers I've seen - always prompt to respond and he's actively developing it further. Can't wait for ParrotAI to go all the way to the moon!</p>

                    <p>I only took 1 hour ago to produce a beautiful blog post. I have to tell you ... this ParrotAI is phenomenal !! I bought Jarvis only 2 days ago but it's NOTHING compared to this.
                        I'm honestly astounded at how "intelligent" it is. My blog post is way better than anything I could have produced. With Jarvis I had to spend a lot of time re-writing,
                        but with ParrotAI I didn't need to rewrite anything. I also have Spin Rewriter but again I have to spend so much time making so many changes because the finished article made no sense.
                        I'll be cancelling Jarvis, for sure!! And I won't be using Spin Rewriter again. I'm very slow with ParrotAI naturally, but when I've read all the help documents and done a tour, I can see I'll be using it every day.
                        You're a lifesaver. üòÄ CONGRATULATIONS on a beautiful, intelligent, and amazing product üòÄ Sincerely, Catherine Rzecki ‚ù§</p>
