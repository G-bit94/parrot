Gun control advocates argue that guns are a danger to society and that owning a gun leads to more deaths than it prevents.\n\nSo, we decided to put both sides of the argument to the test. We decided to find out what gun owners and non-gun owners think about the issue of gun control. We conducted an online survey of 1,000 Americans. The results of the survey show that there is a strong divide in the American public when it comes to gun control.\n\nIt turns out that only about one-third of gun owners think that gun control should be more strict. It turns out that over half of non-gun owners think that gun control should be more strict. The rest of the results are quite interesting.\n\nThe data shows that there is a strong correlation between how much money a person makes and how strict they think gun control should be. It turns out that those who make over $50,000 a year are more likely to think that gun control should be more strict.\n\nThose who own guns are more likely to think that gun control should be more strict. Those who are not gun owners are more likely to think that gun control should be more strict.\n\nThe data shows that there is a strong correlation between how liberal a person is and how strict they think gun control should be.

In the mid-1960s, we saw the American National Rifle Association (NRA) take on gun control and give us the the Gun Control Act of 1968. The NRA has since taken an active role in advocating the expansion and strengthening of gun laws in our country once again. It’s unquestionable that the stances they’re taking matter, but no one single organization is going to get the outcome that’s considered best. Even violence in our country in the past have been over Monopoly, sex, and screwdrivers that “happen by mistake”, not guns. We will see how this plays out wherein the story plays out of favor of the NRA in the courts.\n\nThe NRA argue that no law has ever proven successful in its attempts to reduce gun violence and they go ahead and claim that gun violence varies greatly from one area of the United States to another, which has been proved wrong over and over again. Their logic right now seems to be that gun legislation just won’t reduce the occurrences of gun violence, even though regulation is put in place to reduce their occurrences. They argue that lax laws lead to greater dangers. This could very well be true, but that has nothing to do with the  right to keep and bear arms, and that is what I’m arguing in favor of.\n\nLaw experts argue that guns become more dangerous and easier to get when you choose to omit certain limiting information. One law professor has suggested that the Second Amendment of the US Constitution must be revised to include a clause that regulates gun ownership the same way it regulates ownership of a vehicle in a car accident, where it is required that everyone involved shoulder the equal responsibility of getting in their vehicle. If the owner of the vehicle damages the property of another, or the owner is intoxicated, or the owner of the vehicle is not licensed to own a vehicle, it is clearly the failure of the owner to accurately separate the safety of their own vehicle from that of all others that caused the accident to take place. Conversely, if they are injured in the auto accident, or if someone in the vehicle is injured, road accidents such as these cause life-altering and seemingly immutable injuries that often cut short lives.\n\nThis information is much the same information that NRA foists and lays claim to as being responsible for the bad laws that prohibit the ownership of firearms. Gun control has been an ongoing discussion in our country as the number-one public health problem. Put a gun in the hands of an individual who may suffer from any mental ailment and that is a gun', 1, '2022-09-19', '14:41:20', '2022-11-16 15:41:12'),

just over four thoughts every minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other hand, a supercomputer can process&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-44439515\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">200,000 trillion calculations</a>&nbsp;in a single second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s a LOT of brainpower!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can’t compete with a computer’s speed and knowledge. BUT people have superpowers too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People have emotions, original thoughts, and an understanding of meaning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together with computers, we can make INCREDIBLE steps in technology, science, math, and of course – content creation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you use AI automated content creation for your website, you gain\n a valuable team member that works alongside you to streamline content \ncreation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you ready to see how AI can complement your creation process? \nThen, let’s explore how to work alongside AI and some of the best AI \ntools to use in content creation.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.hyperwriteai.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ai-automated-content-creation-inset-1024x1024.jpg\" alt=\"ai automated content creation\" class=\"wp-image-7348\" width=\"1024\" height=\"1024\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Humans and Computers Work Together in Content Creation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since computers can handle so much more data than people, are you still necessary to create content?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Humans and computers are complimentary – with one huge distinguishing factor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Computers create and analyze data. Humans add meaning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, around 1915, artist Kazmir Malevich painted a famous piece called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/thinksheet/how-to-read-paintings-black-square-by-kazimir-malevich-34f07fa191b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">“The Black Square.”</a>&nbsp;Just as its name suggests, it’s a painting of a large black square set against a white background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Computers analyzed the materials, dimensions, even hidden \ninscriptions behind the paint. But despite computers’ intelligence, they\n still described the painting in terms of compiled data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, people looked at the picture and gave it meaning. The \npainting reflected the change in the world during World War I and how \nsociety was restarting at ground zero.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Artificial intelligence has its place in the creative process. It analyzes data far better than a human mind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But people also have a role in content creation. They are responsible for infusing meaning into the data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AI in content creation does far more than analyze data and suggest \ninformation. It also uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to create \noriginal content and automate human tasks. Together, humans and AI \nautomated content creation can develop faster, more intelligent, and \nmore meaningful online content.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why You Should Use Automated Content Creation Software</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Artificial intelligence offers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.hyperwriteai.com/ai-generated-writing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">greater speed</a>, depth of knowledge, and accuracy than people can achieve independently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If people could perform as fast as machines, we wouldn’t need cars to\n travel, calculators to do the math, and predictive text to write. \nInstead, we recognize our shortcomings and use technology to enhance our\n abilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Computers also have more knowledge than humans. According to \nProfessor Paul Reber from Northwestern University, a human brain’s \nstorage equals about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-is-the-memory-capacity/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">one million gigabytes</a>. A supercomputer, on the other hand, can store data in billions of gigabytes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While automation and computers have their shortcomings in critical \nthinking, they are reliable in calculations and data processing. Because\n of this, computers are used to solve equations, check facts, and \nperform calculated tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The faster, smarter, and more accurate computers and AI become – the \nmore businesses adopt AI into their structure. Already, the use of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.oberlo.com/blog/artificial-intelligence-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">AI has grown by 270%</a>&nbsp;in\n the past four years. Likewise, content creators also use AI tools along\n with human writers for better, faster, and more accurate content.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.hyperwriteai.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Use-of-AI-1024x651.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7340\" width=\"1024\" height=\"651\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Automate Website Content with 6 AI Tools</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are six content AI tools to help you set up automated content creation without taking out the human touch.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Plan Your Content with the Help of AI</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These first two tools save you hours of research time by using AI to \ndevelop blog post ideas that rank well and answer relevant user \nquestions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Frase – All in One AI SEO Content Planner and Tracker</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.frase.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Frase</a>&nbsp;is\n a top-rated AI software for SEO content creation and workflow. It takes\n you through all the stages of research and planning before writing your\n piece.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step turns ideas into keywords. When you enter your topic \ninto Frase, it gives you top searches and questions on that topic. Then,\n you can use those suggestions for post topics or sub-headings within \nyour article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you chose your topic, seamlessly use the information to generate\n a content brief for your writing agency or content creation team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frase doesn’t just stop at the planning stage. Once you write your \narticle, run it through Frase for an SEO score and specific suggestions \nfor optimizing your content. Then, after you publish the article, it \ncontinues to analyze your data, giving you valuable insights into each \npost’s performance and needed updates to remain relevant.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.hyperwriteai.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Frase-1024x652.jpg\" alt=\"frase\" class=\"wp-image-7341\" width=\"1024\" height=\"652\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Concured – Automated Content Optimization and Brief Building</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.concured.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Concured</a>&nbsp;also assists with SEO research, focusing on building a content brief for your writers using data generated by AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can create entire briefs with just a topic idea. From the topic, \nConcured’s platform generates relevant search terms and ideas. \nConcured’s AI will suggest high-quality links, headlines, and word \ncounts to optimize that topic once you decide which topics to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you publish your post, you can analyze its performance through \nConcured’s platform. You can also compare your performance with your \ncompetitors to find any areas to improve in your content creation.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.hyperwriteai.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/concured-1024x585.jpg\" alt=\"concured\" class=\"wp-image-7342\" width=\"1024\" height=\"585\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Organize Your Posts Through Content Automation Software</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The following two tools take out the headache of content \norganization. First, don’t waste your time with spreadsheets and lists \nof past and future posts. Instead, allow AI to organize your content so \nyou can focus where it matters most – the creation process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Trello – Team Management Software for Organizing Tasks and Managing Communication</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://trello.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Trello</a>&nbsp;is\n a workspace for teams to come together and collaborate. For example, if\n you are a content manager, you can use Trello’s system to create to-do \nlists, assign projects, and communicate with your creators all in one \nplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You organize your projects as a series of cards. When you open a card, you see all</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The project’s details</li><li>Who is working on it</li><li>When it’s due</li><li>All conversations associated with the project</li><li>And all attachments</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can save even more time by using their AI system to move lists, \ncreate buttons, highlight the most critical tasks, and automatically \nassign tasks. In addition, Trello seamlessly integrates with other \napplications like Dropbox, Microsoft Teams, Slack, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.hyperwriteai.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Trello-1024x573.jpg\" alt=\"trello\" class=\"wp-image-7343\" width=\"1024\" height=\"573\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>MeetEdgar – Automate Social Media Sharing</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://meetedgar.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MeetEdgar</a>&nbsp;takes\n away the hassle of sharing the content you create by automating social \nmedia tasks. Using MeetEdgar’s calendar and automated scheduling system,\n you can choose what you share and when. MeetEdgar does the rest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the software, you can create a nearly endless library of \ncontent for the system to use. It repurposes and shares old and new \ncontent alike to keep all your social channels active and evergreen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you don’t know what to post on social media, MeetEdgar has \nyour back. It finds quotes, text, and pictures to share, so you don’t \nhave to. Then, go back and track how your posts performed on your social\n sites and test different options to create the most engaging content, \nall from MeetEdgar’s easy-to-use platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.hyperwriteai.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MeetEdgar-1024x640.jpg\" alt=\"meetedgar\" class=\"wp-image-7344\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>Write Your Content with AI Content Creation Tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These last two tools are the most critical part of the creation process – creating the content itself. AI can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.hyperwriteai.com/ai-assisted-writing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">help you write</a>&nbsp;engaging content in half the time using NLP.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grammarly – Automated Grammar and Flow Editing Tool</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://www.grammarly.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Grammarly</a>&nbsp;uses\n AI to scan text and give editing suggestions. It’s a free content \nautomation tool with the option of paying for premium access for even \nmore tips.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are all human and tend to make errors. For example, even those who\n have been writing for years forget commas or capitalize the wrong word.\n Grammarly is an AI editor acting as your second pair of eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to basic grammar checks, it also looks for flow, active \nvoice, rambling sentences, and more to make your writing easy to read \nand understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.hyperwriteai.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Grammarly-1024x672.jpg\" alt=\"grammarly\" class=\"wp-image-7345\" width=\"1024\" height=\"672\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>HyperWrite –AI Writing Tool to Fill in the Blank Page of Your First Draft</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our tool&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hyperwriteai.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">HyperWrite</a>&nbsp;uses\n AI and NLP to automate content based on your writing style and over a \nmillion other pieces of online content used in training. It pulls from \nits knowledge of technique, information, and writing patterns to create \nhuman-like text.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After inputting your topic and outline, HyperWrite begins suggesting \ntext through its ThinkAhead feature and text generation. In seconds, you\n can create hundreds of words that form a logical pattern and flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This text forms your first draft. Using HyperWrite’s editing \nfeatures, you can reword sentences, flesh out ideas, or create more \nconcise thoughts. You can also rewrite awkward text sections and \nrearrange the sentences to form more natural text with greater human \nconnection and meaning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wrote this section using HyperWrite. After generating ideas \ncentered around how HyperWrite streamlines the writing process, I was \nable to edit the sentences to form natural-sounding thoughts and \noriginal ideas in a matter of seconds.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img src=\"https://blog.hyperwriteai.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/HyperWrite-1024x466.jpg\" alt=\"ai automated content creation tool\" class=\"wp-image-7346\" width=\"1024\" height=\"466\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Start Adding AI Content Creation Tools to Your Workforce</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From content planning to content organization and even content creation – AI has your back!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don’t need to waste hours on tedious or mundane content-creation \ntasks.

If you want to increase the number of visitors on your site, then content is the way to do it. When you publish great content that’s valuable and helpful for readers, they will be attracted by it and visit your site more often. This article will show you how content marketing can increase traffic on any website or blog in the long run.\n\nWhat You Need To Know About Content Marketing:\n\nThe first thing that you need to know about content marketing is that it’s not a new concept at all – this has been around for years now, but only recently have we begun seeing a widespread adoption of this strategy among businesses and marketers alike. Whether you are already using this strategy or are just getting started with it, here are some tips for making sure that your efforts pay off:\n\n1) Make sure there’s value in what you write…and make sure there’s value in what others write as well! You don’t want people to come back because they think they should (or because someone paid them), but because they like what they see when visiting your site or checking out an article on another site (or even how much time they spend reading).

An affiliate is someone who promotes products on their website.

With traditional methods of content generation, it can be quite difficult (and costly) to scale up your output quickly and efficiently. However, with Jasper AI, you can simply add more licenses as needed and instantly increase your output tenfold without breaking the bank.<br>The Cons of Jasper AI Content<br>1.It lacks emotionality .<br>One downside of Jasper AI content is that it can often lack emotionality or personality. This isn\'t necessarily a bad thing—after all, not every piece of content needs to be dripping with personality—but it\'s something to keep in mind when deciding whether or not Jasper AI is right for your needs.<br>2.It can be difficult to make edits .<br>Another downside of Jasper AI-generated content is that it can be difficult (though not impossible) to make edits after the fact. This is due to the fact that much of the \"content\" is actually generated by algorithms rather than human beings. As such, there can be a bit of a learning curve when it comes to making changes or additions after the fact.<br>3..It\'s not perfect .<br>Of course, no technology is perfect—and Jasper AI content is no exception. Despite its many advantages, there are still some areas where Jasper AI falls short (though we imagine that will change as the technology continues to evolve). For example, at present there are some issues with grammar and syntax when using Jasper AI to generate longer pieces of content such as blog posts or articles.

It\'s personal.\n\nWhen you write something yourself, it\'s bound to be more personal than something that was written by a machine.

We\'re able to use our emotions and experiences to connect with our audience on a deeper level, which is something that machines are not yet able to do.\n\n2. It\'s more trustworthy.\n\nSince human-written content is more personal, it\'s also more trustworthy. When you read something that was written by a real person, you know that they\'re sharing their honest opinion and not just trying to sell you something. This is not the case with machine-generated content, which is often full of marketing jargon and empty promises.\n\n3. It\'s more engaging.\n\nHuman-written content is also more engaging than machine-generated content. This is because humans are able to tell stories and use humor in a way that machines cannot. We\'re also able to use our unique experiences to connect with our audience on a more personal level, which is something that machines are not yet able to do.\n\nCons:\n\n1.

Once they\'ve accumulated enough points, they can then redeem them for a discount on their next purchase. Other programs might offer tiered benefits, such as giving bigger discounts to customers who spend more money or make more purchases. Still others might offer a flat discount to all customers who enroll in the program.</div><div><br></div><div>5. The difference between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty</div><div>It\'s important to understand the difference between customer satisfaction and customer loyalty when it comes to rewards and loyalty programs.

It offers a unique freedom and flexibility that traditional office jobs simply can\'t match. Here are just a few of the reasons why working from home is great. \n\n                    First of all, working from home allows you to be in control of your own schedule. You can decide when to start and finish work, and you don\'t have to worry about the rigid 9-5 structure that comes with an office job. This means that you can fit your work around your life, rather than the other way around. \n\n                    Another great benefit of working from home is that you can work from anywhere. You can work from the comfort of your own home, or you can take your laptop and work from a cafe, a park, or even a beach. This gives you the freedom to work in different environments and to explore new places. \n\n                    Working from home also eliminates the need for a commute. This means that you can save both time and money, as you don\'t have to worry about the cost of transport or the time it takes to get to and from the office. \n\n                    Remote working also allows you to work with people from all over the world. You can collaborate with colleagues from different countries and cultures, and you can learn from their experiences and perspectives. This can open up new opportunities and help you to develop your skills in a way that would not be possible in an office environment. \n\n                    Finally, working from home can help to reduce stress. Without the distractions of the office, you can focus on the tasks at hand and be more productive. You can also take regular breaks to relax and recharge, which can help to reduce stress levels and improve your mental wellbeing. \n\n                    Working from home offers a unique freedom and flexibility that can\'t be found in traditional office jobs. It allows you to be in control of your own schedule, to work from anywhere, to save time and money on commuting, to collaborate with people from all over the world, and to reduce stress. All of these benefits make working from home a great option for those who want to make the most of their time and their lives.<br>', 4, '2022-12-08', '12:25:43', '2022-12-08 09:25:43'),
(505, 'lGgUsKPRBzUxL9umRTvDHw==', 161, 'Working from home has become increasingly popular in recent years, and it is easy to see why. \n                    With the rise of remote work, more and more people are finding the freedom to work from \n                    wherever they please. This is great news for those who want to save money on commuting \n                    costs, reduce their environmental footprint, and find more flexibility in their work life. \n                    Here are some of the key benefits of working from home. \n\n                    1. Increased Productivity \n\n                    Working from home can increase productivity in several ways. First, it eliminates the need to \n                    commute, which can take up a lot of time. Second, it allows for more control over your work \n                    environment, which can help you focus better. Finally, it eliminates the need to interact with \n                    coworkers, which can be distracting. \n\n                    2. Flexibility \n\n                    Working from home provides a great deal of flexibility. You can work when it suits you, and you \n                    don’t have to worry about the traditional 9-5 schedule. This can be especially beneficial for \n                    those with families or other commitments, as it allows them to work around their other \n                    responsibilities. \n\n                    3.

It offers a number of benefits that traditional office work simply cannot match. From increased freedom to improved productivity, here are just a few of the reasons why working from home is great. \n\n                    1. Increased Freedom \n\n                    One of the biggest benefits of working from home is the increased freedom it provides. Unlike traditional office work, remote work allows you to work from anywhere in the world, as long as you have access to the internet. This means that you can work from the comfort of your own home, or even while traveling. You can also work at any time of the day or night, allowing you to create a work schedule that works best for you. \n\n                    2. Improved Productivity \n\n                    Working from home can also lead to improved productivity. Without the distractions of a traditional office environment, you can focus on the task at hand and get more done in less time. Additionally, being able to work in a comfortable environment can help reduce stress and make it easier to stay focused. \n\n                    3. Cost Savings \n\n                    Working from home can also lead to significant cost savings. Without the need to commute to an office, you can save money on gas, parking, and other transportation costs. Additionally, you can save money on meals by being able to prepare your own food at home. \n\n                    4. Flexibility \n\n                    Working from home also offers a great deal of flexibility. You can take breaks whenever you need to, and you can also adjust your work schedule to accommodate other commitments. This can be especially helpful for those with families, as it allows them to balance work and family life more easily. \n\n                    5. Improved Mental Health \n\n                    Finally, working from home can also lead to improved mental health. Without the stress of a traditional office environment, you can take the time to relax and focus on yourself. This can lead to improved mood and increased motivation, making it easier to stay on top of work. \n\n                    Working from home can be a great way to increase your freedom, improve your productivity, and save money. It can also lead to improved mental health and increased flexibility.

As we move into 2023, it is important to consider the trends that may shape the crypto market in the coming years. In this article, we will explore the potential crypto trends in 2023 and what investors can expect. \n\nThe first trend to consider is the increasing use of blockchain technology. Blockchain is the underlying technology behind cryptocurrencies, and it has the potential to revolutionize the way we store, transfer, and manage data. In 2023, we can expect to see more companies and organizations using blockchain technology to improve their operations. This could include companies using blockchain to track their supply chain, or financial institutions using blockchain to improve the speed and security of their transactions. \n\nAnother trend to consider is the emergence of stablecoins. Stablecoins are digital assets that are pegged to a fiat currency, such as the US dollar. These coins offer investors the ability to hedge against the volatility of the crypto market, as well as providing a more secure way to store and transfer value. We can expect to see an increase in the number of stablecoins in 2023, as well as more companies and organizations using them for their operations. \n\nThe third trend to consider is the emergence of decentralized finance (DeFi). DeFi is a new type of financial system that is built on top of blockchain technology. It allows users to access financial services without relying on a centralized authority, such as a bank or government. We can expect to see an increase in the number of DeFi projects in 2023, as well as more companies and organizations using DeFi to improve their operations. \n\nFinally, we can expect to see an increase in the number of crypto exchanges in 2023. Crypto exchanges are platforms that allow users to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies. These exchanges are becoming increasingly popular, as they offer users a secure and convenient way to access the crypto market. We can expect to see an increase in the number of crypto exchanges in 2023, as well as more companies and organizations using them for their operations. \n\nOverall, 2023 is shaping up to be an exciting year for the crypto market. We can expect to see an increase in the use of blockchain technology, the emergence of stablecoins, the emergence of DeFi projects, and an increase in the number of crypto exchanges. Investors should keep an eye on these trends and be prepared for the changes that may come in the coming years. \n', 4, '2022-12-21', '17:31:10', '2022-12-21 14:31:10');

You seem to know more about me than I do.\n\nJay: If not you then 3/4 of your phone book did, standing beyond the fringes of the fray doesn\'t absolve you of paganistic festivals. It is quite in order to ask your girlfriend jingle bells all the way!\n\nMike: More like 9/10 actually which is more or less equal to the proportion of folks on this forum who did, but we can\'t all believe that the position of Alpha Centauri and the number of Jupiter\'s moons influences my personality and future without questioning how.\n\nThat statistic is interesting actually from a psycho-social point of view, if you dare employ the logical thinking you\'re trying to rebuff. It shows just how easy it is to imprint ideas on the minds of most folks. I\'d hate to be that susceptible to BS because I confound cause with coincidence.\n\nSkepticism bore the world we\'re living in by adopting a serious, scholarly and scientific approach to hitherto \"supernatural\" or \"paranormal\" phenomena. That\'s why I\'d expect no less of myself, and anyone else for that matter especially in this century.\n\nJay: On the contrary I seek not to rebuff logical construct, just an advocate for equality in the sense of a merger between the left and right spheres of the mind. Order precedes chaos and vice versa, this isn\'t BS but actual literature from a close circle of celebrated swiss Dr Carl Jung, I\'d be loathe to assume that the venerated psychology titan had as firm a grip on a serious scholarly and scientific approach to education as you.\n\nMike: Catch me dead trying to marry a school of thought that speaks of \"merging the left and right spheres of the mind\" with logic and science. It just sounds like a lazy, desperate effort to make your old, outdated beliefs sound more credible. Yours is a moot point if not an effort in futility my friend.\n\nIf your superstitions were presented in a more critical light, I wouldn\'t be so dismissive. There\'s simply no place for superstitions anymore. Anything put forward is subject to the rigors of scientific examination, no matter how venerable the source. Even the most respected figures can be wrong or have their own biases and limitations.\n\nWe\'ve actually made leaps and bounds since Jung put forward his propositions, and I\'m more than certain he would belong to a different school of thought today if he had the chance to enjoy convenient access to knowledge in this century like you.\n\nHe\'d probably laugh you out of town for steadfastly holding to archaic ways of thinking as if they were gospel.\n\nJay: 1st paragraph of your reply belittles the written works of Dr Carl Jung absent an intent to inquire on the article I bring forth.\n\n2nd paragraph denotes your preference for logic and the mistrust for archaic knowledge.\n\n3rd and 4th are an arrogant preposition that serves to belittle scholars articles.\n\nTo that end I believe this back and forth is pointless, to each their own elder.\n\nMike:  Yeah, you had to trivialize my response.\n\nAnyway, I was simply pointing out the fact that it\'s time to move forward and discard outdated, illogical ways of thinking if they can\'t stand scientific scrutiny. You and I have the benefit of hindsight and the tools to scientifically examine concepts and hypotheses so why not be critical and discerning when it comes to accepting ideas, however dated?\n\nDr. Jung\'s work isn\'t exempt from critical examination so if the premise of his writings on finding a nexus between science and the metaphysical realm isn\'t convincing enough, how\'s it sensible to cling to them? After all alchemy, which he was a major proponent of is nothing but pseudoscience. I\'m not trying to take anything away from him.\n\nIf we don\'t question what these old disciplines teach, then we\'re perpetuating outdated, potentially harmful beliefs. I\'m inviting you, @kaynety, @SonOfTheSoil and co to be open-minded and welcome the habit of asking questions. Challenge assumptions and embrace empirical evidence. That\'s what science is all about.\n \nJay: In the spirit of being open minded and asking questions, I have a final one. What is your scientific opinion on dreams? \n\nMike: I\'m no expert in neuroscience but the little I know is that dreams are an avenue for the human brain to consolidate memories and help in the problem-solving of complex thoughts. What does your camp have to say about them?\n\nJay: Plenty about the subconscious and it\'s mode of communication to the ego or the conscious mind.\n\nMike: Would that hold up to scientific scrutiny through such tools as neurochemistry? Would it be verifiable? Also, animals have been shown to dream, just like humans. Do animals have a subconscious ergo a conscious mind and ego?\n\nJay: I haven\'t had the time to inquire from the animals I own, however when you said dreams aid in complex problem solving how is that any different from your subconscious communicating to your conscious?\n\nMike: For starters, one is a process of the brain that is observable and measurable scientifically, while the other is still a matter of speculation. Neurochemistry has been used to map the brain\'s activities during sleep and interpret what the dreamer was experiencing. That lends a lot more credibility to my hypothesis than your yet-to-be-verified (and almost unverifiable) theories.\n\nAlso, do not confound wakefulness with consciousness.\n\nJay: You seem knowledgeable in neurochemistry, so tell me more about this measurable tool, does it map out the brain activity to the point it displays the images in the dream?\n\nDon\'t claim ownership over an already developed hypothesis!\n\nMike: LOL. Calm down. Maybe I should have said \"our\" hypothesis to mean we of rational thinking.\n\nTo your question on measurement, I am under no obligation to answer that as it neighbours the trivial and ridiculous.\n\nJay: So you\'ve ran out of smart arse answers have you?\n\nIt\'s a simple question not a trivial nor ridiculous one as the whole point of dreams is the content which ought to entail both the material and the subjects reactions, so does the machine record the actual dreams or does it not?\n\nMike: Oh, I\'m sure I can come up with a few more smart-alecky answers.\n\nBut wait, no, I don\'t have to. Anyhow, to the best of my knowledge, it doesn\'t actually record a person\'s dreams. What it does is measure brain activity, eye movements and the like which provide clues and insights into the dreaming process. EEGs, for example, can measure electrical signals in the brain while PET scans measure blood flow in parts of the brain associated with dreaming. It\'s a work in progress and if you don\'t want to understand that, you\'re a moron.\n\nNow, quit deflections and ask a sensible question.\n\nJay: I already asked my question on the images and the short answer is no, it cannot!\nThe machine in all it\'s splendor does not record images experienced in the dream and that is what the good doctor and his peers attempted to interpret what the images, and more importantly their symbology attempt to communicate to the conscious mind.\n\nFor example, there\'s one common dream about soaring through the air, and upon the dreamers realization of flight, he/she tends to fall down no longer capable of the feat.\n\nWhat does the ability of flight mean to the subject?\n\nWhy is he/she capable of realizing they can fly?\n\nWhy does he/she fall?\n\nEach individual has their own psyche so dreams and more importantly their CONTENTS so each and every single dream is unique as well as the patterns within it.\n\nThe whole point is symbology, and symbols especially old ones have never been restrained by language, there have an deeper meaning, barely seen on the surface.\n\nIt\'s a new year oh rational one, include poetry in your life not insults!\n\nMike: LOL.\nI\'m not even sure what you\'ve typed is poetic,\nNeither am I sure it was a sarcastic dig or polemic,\nPerhaps a frantic attempt to make the olden seem more charismatic,\nBut I\'m sure it was anything but epic or scientific,\nAnd it\'s actually something I\'d expect from a manic schizophrenic.\n\nI\'m serving you poetic insults in case it\'s not clear,\nBecause I\'m all for vawulence anytime of the year,\nNow, you can keep dreaming up myths and theories,\nBut reality is what we need to make everything in life clear.\n\nYour outdated beliefs over time have been reduced to shite,\nSo get your head out of your aㅤss, and open your eyes to the light.\n\nBy the way, your attempts at sarcasm are nothing but farce,\nAnd your attempts at logic have been left in arrears,\nThe ancient symbols you cling to have no place in this age,\nYour ancient thinking should be locked away in a cage,\nNo matter how hard you try to make it sound sage.\n\nAll said, your stubbornness is an affront to this century\'s logic,\nBukowski, Jung and Freud would agree,\nThat you should give up your ancient ways and be free,\nAnd never again should you try to argue with me,\nAnd never again should you try to be so iconic through poetry.\n\nBack to the content of dreams, the general understanding is that flight usually symbolizes freedom and liberation, while falling down denotes a fear of failure or being overwhelmed. It can also represent a fear of success or a desire to be grounded.\n\nWhile there are some common themes, as you mentioned, each dream is unique and can only be interpreted by the dreamer themselves. Symbols can represent a range of different things and often have multiple layers of meaning. Science has no explanation yet\n\nThe interpretation of the symbols in dreams can be subjective but as I said before, it should be open to critical examination and scientific inquiry and that\'s why I said it\'s a moot point trying to marry science and superstition. Superstition shouldn\'t begin where science is at a loss or yet to come up with an explanation. Logic should tell you so.\n\nI\'m not sure how I got to writing rhyming poetry or why I even got down this rabbit hole with you. Nevertheless, I\'d like to remind you that my point is that if we don\'t critically examine what these old disciplines teach, we\'re just perpetuating archaic beliefs that have nothing to offer humanity besides wishful thinking and delusional solutions.\n\nSo if there\'s no new reasonable question, it\'s time to move on my friend.\n\nJay: I actually did a paper last year, a Master, about neuromarketing. It was, and it is, to my understanding that tools such as EEGs are specifically used to denote a person\'s interests, at least in the marketing context. The tool will measure an individual\'s brain activity when subjected to a specific phenomenon. I am struggling to understand how that applies to dreams and just how exactly researchers discern what was covered in the dream.\n\nMike:  \nEEGs can measure brain activity in sleep,\nAnd link it to certain dream states however deep,\nThe idea behind that is emotions can be found,\nThrough brain activity, eye movements all around,\nAnd contraction of facial muscles that abound.\n\nThey can\'t directly record the dream sequence,\nBut by asking subjects what was experienced,\nScientists can link it to brain measurements,\nAnd infer the dream\'s nature from the facial expressions,\n\nTo you Brian resident of Githurai 44 I must say,\nBe critical and ask questions to what people like Jung say,\nChallenge assumptions and embrace empirical evidence,\nSo that you will be spared the shame of being naive\n\nThe interpretation of the dream\'s content,\nAnd symbols is very subjective in intent,\nWhich makes it easy to be taken in by claims,\nThat are baseless and rooted in wishful thinking, not facts.\n\nJay: And to you Mike I retort, that besides 44 actually being a pretty decent neighborhood to reside in, the patterns within the fields of the subconscious are abstract and thus can be considered a qualitative variable and not quantitative, and while gadgets and their flashy gizmos impressive as they are have yet to scan images therein.\n\nDr Jung laid down the premises of the contested by the um..shall we say rationalists, of the ego and the subconscious. This has brought about in occultic leaning cartoons the aspect of a protagonist whilst in a dilemma and angel popping on one shoulder advising caution while a devil popping on the other advising throwing caution to the wind, countless series bear the same blueprint of a holy vs a rubble rousing friend and this is by design.\n\nAs far as naivety goes, it takes a special sort of stupid for a man to discard knowledge in the name of being archaic and outdated, while better men than you have sought to consolidate the importance of symbolism in this modern world.\n\nI gave an example of the Qatari world cup insignia bearing the resemblance of Ourubus, a snake devouring it\'s own tail.\n\nAnother I\'ll provide is primitive tribes preference to exemplify a virtue by an animal, Kings in Africa preferring lions and leopard skins, Kings in Europe preference for Wolf and bear fur, stone age paintings of animals found deep in caves, Ancient Egyptians with Seth..and tons more.\n\nUnlike you I don\'t pout my bony chest out and proclaim that certain works of esteemed mind are nonsense nor hoist my skirts up and turn my nose on knowledge because it predates the first time I burst a nut.\n\nI intend to dedicate a huge chunk of 2023 to study subjective symbols, and if that earns me shame of naivety then so be it, society as is stands currently is full of sh\'t anyway.\n\nMike:\nWhen you put words in my mouth like that,\nit takes to reason that you be taken to task,\nFor I never said that Jung\'s works were nonsense,\nonly that they should be subjected to rigors of modern science.\n\nYour type have the tendency to see shadows in the dark,\nwhen the light of logic and reason can illuminate your heart,\nYour case in point of the Qatar insignia,\nis no proof that superstition should not be questioned,\nAs for stone age paintings and ancient Egyptians,\nThey are part of history,\nnot the present day equation.\nCause and coincidence are not to be confounded,\nAnd I\'m afraid your approach precludes further discourse along that course.\n\nThe interpretation of symbols depends on the individual,\nWhich is why it\'s imperative to be critical and question them in a scientific way,\nSo that the truth is revealed and not what we want to hear.\n\nSymbols have their place in the modern world,\nBut the interpretation must be able to be unfurled,\nIt\'s no longer acceptable to take them at face value,\nWe must be critical and question, that\'s the rational we must solve.\n\nAs for naivety, it takes a special kind of irrational boldness,\nTo cling to superstition and ignore scientific evidence,\nWithout questioning the validity of its source,\nAnd calling it a day without any recourse.\n\nYou\'re something of a clod,\nIf you don\'t have the courage to be critical of what these old disciplines teach,\nDo not be ashamed of your naivety,\nBut instead strive for veritable knowledge that\'s rooted in logic!\nSo, when it comes to ancient ways of thinking,\nDon\'t be afraid to challenge assumptions,\nAnd embrace empirical evidence for solutions.\n\nOtherwise, if dedicating time to studying symbols is what you choose,\nI\'d suggest you arm yourself with knowledge and facts,\nAnd be open to critical examination and scientific inquiry.\nSo don\'t be afraid to ask questions,\nAnd use science to prove the assertions,\nFor the future is here, and it\'s time to move on.\n\nYour a priori argument is a fallacy, if not a fallacy of logic,\nSo it\'s time to break away from symbols and mythic,\nAnd embrace the modern world with its science and logic,\nAnd leave the old ways behind, where they belong,\nIn the realm of myth and superstition,\nNow, where do I claim compensation for bearing your incoherent retort?\n\nJay: Not sure if you are taking advantage of ChatGPT ama nini, but that makes hella lot of sense\n\nMike: \nI could say I\'m slighted by your insinuation,\nBut your indignation and cynicism are understandable,\nAfter all, folks here are used to drab juvenile babble,\nNevertheless, my smart-ass answers as Bukowski here calls them,\nAre products of my intellect and my intuition,\nWhich coupled with a flare for rhymes and puns,\nAnd droll wit and a knack for word play,\nHelps me make those sensible grounded assertions and deductions,\nAnd serve them as hot as you find them.', 1, '2023-01-04', '12:05:52', '2023-01-04 14:34:41'),

(533, '7iewUNdyKV133HdDhE8h+g==', 1, 'I\'m a freelance web developer. &nbsp;I started working for someone (Francesca) in the UK a few months ago but they have been taking a long time to settle the outstanding payment. It\'s been almost six months since the payment was due as of today, and I\'m really struggling to make ends meet. I\'ve tried reaching out to her a few times, but she always has an excuse for why the payment is delayed.<br><br>The first excuse was that she was waiting on payments from her own clients and needed to invoice her brother (she sort of sub-contracted me for a web project by her brother). Then, she told me that the currency had crashed in her country (she blamed Brexit) and she was having trouble getting the payment to me. I was really understanding and patient at first, but as the months went by and the payment still didn\'t come through, I started to get really worried. I\'ve had to borrow money just to afford basic necessities like food, and I\'m really struggling to make ends meet.<br><br>What\'s been really frustrating is the fact that she seems to ignore my requests. I haven\'t been messaging her incessantly - far from that. Her last reply was two months ago and I had to wait almost a month for it. I have only messaged her once since then and that was a month ago. We used to communicate daily on WhatsApp and she\'d reply within seconds back then.<br><br>I should say that something she did on the very last day I worked for her spooked me. She seemed to be parting ways with me albeit very indirectly. I mean, she asked me to transfer and change ownership of all docs, passwords e.t.c. (and rightfully so) to her. She also mentioned that she\'d be sending some payment through \"soon\" (of course that didn\'t happen). She never mentioned that she was cancelling the project I was working on but that was the last day she sent work my way. It seemed to me that she\'d made up her mind earlier but wasn\'t willing to explicitly tell me so for God knows what reason. I later asked her where we stood in terms of work a day or two later but she completely ignored that.<br><br>I should also note that our agreement was for payment every two weeks, but she never stuck to that. I let it slide the 3 times she paid me because I trusted her.<br><br>I was blindsided by this situation because the payment was due for three months by the time I stopped working for her plus all along, she\'d led me to believe I had no reason to worry. I wasn\'t prepared for the prolonged delay (my fault). I haven\'t been able to recover from having to work for three months with no pay, and I\'m in a dire situation now. I\'m barely able to afford meals, and I really need the money by the end of this month.<br><br>I\'m at my wit\'s end here and I don\'t know what to do. Some people have suggested going the legal route but I\'m not sure how that would work across borders. With her being in the UK, I\'m thinking that there may be just one too many hoops to jump to get my modest sum (about $1500 - potentially life-changing in my current situation) that it might not make much financial sense in the end. I hope I\'m wrong on that.<br><br>Here\'s my conversation with them:<br><br>14 Sept 2022, Kelvin: Hey Francesca, I trust you\'re well. I\'m just checking with you to see where we stand in terms of work, payment and the way forward. I know you\'ve been and are quite busy but I was hoping you could spare a moment to share your thoughts on the aforementioned.<br><br>30 Sept 2022, Kelvin:&nbsp;<br><br>Hey Francesca,&nbsp;<br><br>I haven\'t heard from you for some time now. I last reached out more than 2 weeks ago, are things okay? I needed to know where we stand regarding work and payment so I can make plans for my living.&nbsp;<br><br>Please do let me know when I can expect to receive the outstanding payment. It has been more than 3 months since the last one and I unfortunately haven\'t had the chance to brace for my current situation.<br><br>I really hope to hear from you before making any decision. Thanks.<br><br>30 Sept 2022, Francesca: I know Kelvin, I am so so sorry for the delay and delay in reply. I was away and I thought everything would be ready to sort out once I got back but it is not yet. Apologies Kelvin, I am still chasing payments from my brother and since the currency has crashed here this is taking a long time. Since I have not been paid any back payments I have nothing to pass forward until that happens. I will let you know as soon as I do and then I will review the timesheets. I know it is frustrating, I am frustrated myself and having to borrow money myself to cover expenses until I get any of the payments.<br><br>30 Sept 2022, Kelvin: It\'s OK, I understand now - I needed to know what was happening on your end so I can plan my next move. As it stands, I too have been forced to borrow and make compromises as I wasn\'t prepared for the delay. It\'s unfortunate but we have to wait it out, I guess. Anyways, I hope things turn for the better soon before it gets any worse.<br><br>29 Nov 2022, Kelvin: Hey Francesca! I hope you\'re doing well. I\'m writing to check in and see if there has been any progress on the payment front. It\'s now been two months since our last conversation and more since the payment was due. I\'m sure you understand how difficult this situation has been for me, as I\'m sure it has been for you. I\'m hoping that you can help me out here and make the payment as soon as possible. I\'m really hoping you can find a way to make the payment soon so that I can get back on track. I would really appreciate it if you could do this for me. Please let me know what I can do to help expedite the process. Thank you for your time and understanding.<br><br>It\'s already a new year (2023). I have a feeling she\'s withholding my payment and most people I\'ve shared my story with share the same sentiments. I\'m thinking of letting her know that I will I directly ask for payment from her brother (whom I\'m not even sure is aware that someone else did the website)?I\'d also like to have her know that I can\'t wait any longer and she\'ll have to at least make a partial payment. I can\'t afford to keep waiting for the payment indefinitely.<br><br>8 Jan 2023, Kelvin: Hi Francesca,<br><br>I hope this finds you well. It\'s unfortunate that I haven\'t received a response from you since reaching out several weeks ago. I understand my message may have fallen through the cracks as you\'ve probably been super busy, but I am compelled to reach out again as I am in a very difficult financial situation.<br><br>I have been patient and understanding for as long as I could, but the prolonged delay of the overdue payment has had a significant impact on my financial well-being. It has been a great hardship for me, and as hard as it it for me to admit it, I am struggling to make ends meet.<br><br><br>I really hope you can understand the gravity of the situation I am in. I\'m at my wit\'s end here and I am now at a point where I am considering reaching out to Anthony with regards to my work on Blklite.<br><br><br>Our agreement was for payment every two weeks, and I was willing to be flexible when the payments were delayed in the past. However, it has now been several months since the payment was due, and I am in a very difficult situation as a result. I hope that you can understand my plight, frustration and the desperation I am feeling.<br><br>I truly hope that we can find a way to resolve this matter as soon as possible as my situation gets dire by the day.<br><br>Kelvin.<br><br>', 3, '2023-01-08', '16:45:21', '2023-01-08 13:45:21'),

It\'s been more than six months since the payment was due as of today, and I\'m really struggling to make ends meet. I\'ve tried reaching out to her a few times, but she always has an excuse for why the payment is delayed.<br><br>The first excuse was that she was waiting on payments from her own clients and needed to invoice her brother (she sort of sub-contracted me for a web project by her brother). Then, she told me that the currency had crashed in her country (she blamed Brexit) and she was having trouble getting the payment to me. I was really understanding and patient at first, but as the months went by and the payment still didn\'t come through, I started to get really worried. I\'ve had to borrow money just to afford basic necessities like food, and I\'m really struggling to make ends meet.<br><br>What\'s been really frustrating is the fact that she seems to ignore my requests. I haven\'t been messaging her incessantly - far from that. Her last reply was two months ago and I had to wait almost a month for it. I have only messaged her once since then and that was a month ago. We used to communicate daily on WhatsApp and she\'d reply within seconds back then.<br><br>This is our conversation since I stopped working with her. She\'s on only ever replied once.<br><br>14 Sept 2022 [Kelvin] - Hey Francesca, I trust you\'re well. I\'m just checking with you to see where we stand in terms of work, payment and the way forward. I know you\'ve been and are quite busy but I was hoping you could spare a moment to share your thoughts on the aforementioned.<br><br><br>30th Sept 2022&nbsp; [Kelvin] - Hey Francesca,&nbsp;<br><br>I haven\'t heard from you for some time now. I last reached out more than 2 weeks ago, are things okay? I needed to know where we stand regarding work and payment so I can make plans for my living.&nbsp;<br><br>Please do let me know when I can expect to receive the outstanding payment. It has been more than 3 months since the last one and I unfortunately haven\'t had the chance to brace for my current situation.<br><br>I really hope to hear from you before making any decision. Thanks.<br><br><br><br>30 Sept 2022 [Francesca] - I know Kelvin, I am so so sorry for the delay and delay in reply. I was away and I thought everything would be ready to sort out once I got back but it is not yet. Apologies Kelvin, I am still chasing payments from my brother and since the currency has crashed here this is taking a long time. Since I have not been paid any back payments I have nothing to pass forward until that happens. I will let you know as soon as I do and then I will review the timesheets. I know it is frustrating, I am frustrated myself and having to borrow money myself to cover expenses until I get any of the payments.<br><br><br>14 Sept 2022 [Kelvin] - It\'s OK, I understand now - I needed to know what was happening on your end so I can plan my next move. As it stands, I too have been forced to borrow and make compromises as I wasn\'t prepared for the delay. It\'s unfortunate but we have to wait it out, I guess. Anyways, I hope things turn for the better soon before it gets any worse.<br><br>29 Nov 2022 [Kelvin] - Hey Francesca! I hope you\'re doing well. I\'m writing to check in and see if there has been any progress on the payment front. It\'s now been two months since our last conversation and more since the payment was due. I\'m sure you understand how difficult this situation has been for me, as I\'m sure it has been for you. I\'m hoping that you can help me out here and make the payment as soon as possible. I\'m really hoping you can find a way to make the payment soon so that I can get back on track. I would really appreciate it if you could do this for me. Please let me know what I can do to help expedite the process. Thank you for your time and understanding.<br><br>8 Jan 2023 [Kelvin] - Hi Francesca,<br><br>I hope this finds you well. It\'s unfortunate that I haven\'t received a response from you since reaching out several weeks ago. I understand my message may have fallen through the cracks as you\'ve probably been super busy, but I am compelled to reach out again as I am in a very difficult financial situation.<br><br>I have been patient and understanding for as long as I could, but the prolonged delay of the overdue payment has had a significant impact on my financial well-being. It has been a great hardship for me, and as hard as it it for me to admit it, I am struggling to make ends meet.<br><br><br>I really hope you can understand the gravity of the situation I am in. I\'m at my wit\'s end here and I am now at a point where I am considering reaching out to Anthony with regards to my work on Blklite.<br><br><br>Our agreement was for payment every two weeks, and I was willing to be flexible when the payments were delayed in the past. However, it has now been several months since the payment was due, and I am in a very difficult situation as a result. I hope that you can understand my plight, frustration and the desperation I am feeling.<br><br>I truly hope that we can find a way to resolve this matter as soon as possible as my situation gets dire by the day.<br><br>Kelvin.<br><br>I\'d like to get in touch with her brother and let him know that besides the work I did for her personally for about 5 months, I worked on creating his website called Blklite and did a few tasks related to SLX Atlanta. I would like him to know that I have a timesheet with the times I worked on those projects for which I haven\'t received any payment.<br><br>', 1, '2023-01-12', '20:43:26', '2023-01-12 17:43:26'),

As more and more organizations invest in data security, Python is becoming an increasingly popular choice for developers and security professionals alike. This article will explore the ways in which Python is being used to revolutionize the field of cybersecurity. \n\nOne of the primary benefits of using Python for cybersecurity is its ease of use. Unlike many other programming languages, Python does not require a great deal of technical knowledge or experience to master. It is also relatively easy to learn, making it ideal for those who are new to programming or are just starting out in the field of cybersecurity. \n\nPython can be used to create secure networks, detect malware and even prevent data breaches. By writing code in Python, developers can create applications that help protect sensitive information from hackers and cyber criminals. Additionally, developers can use Python to analyze large datasets and search for patterns that could indicate malicious activity on a network or system. \n\nAnother advantage of using Python for cybersecurity is its scalability. Because it is so versatile, developers can easily scale up their programs as needed without having to rewrite large chunks of code or start from scratch each time they need to make changes or add features. This makes it easier for organizations to keep up with changing security threats and quickly respond if an attack occurs. \n\nAdditionally, Python makes it possible for developers to develop custom tools that can be used to monitor networks and detect potential threats before they become serious issues. By writing scripts in Python, developers can automate tasks such as scanning logs and analyzing network traffic for suspicious activity. This helps organizations stay ahead of malicious actors who may be trying to gain access to their systems or steal valuable data. \n\nFinally, by leveraging the power of machine learning algorithms written in Python, organizations can identify potential threats faster than ever before. Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze vast amounts of data quickly and accurately identify patterns that could indicate malicious activity on a system or network. This helps organizations stay one step ahead when it comes to defending against cyber attacks and ensuring their networks remain secure at all times. \n\nIn conclusion, it’s clear that Python has become an invaluable asset when it comes to protecting networks from cyberattacks and ensuring data remains secure at all times. With its ease-of-use, scalability and powerful machine learning algorithms, there’s no doubt that this versatile\n\n\n<br>', 4, '2023-01-13', '00:12:38', '2023-01-12 21:12:38'),

This means that each element can have only one ID, and each page can have only one element with this ID. When using the same ID on multiple elements, the code wont pass validation.<br><br>URL: https://www.w3docs.com/learn-css/css-id-and-class.html<br><br>[2] In most cases, it is preferable to add a class to an element instead of an ID. However, if using the ID is the only way to target the element â€” perhaps because you do not have access to the markup and cannot edit it â€” this will work. Summary That wraps up Type, class, and ID selectors.<br><br>URL: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors/Type_Class_and_ID_Selectors<br><br>[3] In CSS, id s look like #elementID and class elements look like .someClass In general, use id whenever you want to refer to a specific element and class when you have a number of things that are all alike. For instance, common id elements are things like header, footer, sidebar. Common class elements are things like highlight or external-link.<br><br>URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/544010/whats-the-difference-between-an-id-and-a-class<br><br>[4] This is much like IDs and Classes. Information that is reusable should be kept in a class and information that is totally unique should be kept in an ID. IDs have special browser functionality Classes have no special abilities in the browser, but IDs do have one very important trick up their sleeve. This is the hash value in the URL.<br><br>URL: https://css-tricks.com/the-difference-between-id-and-class/<br><br>[5] When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and its used by JavaScript.<br><br>URL: https://careerkarma.com/blog/css-class-vs-id-2/<br><br>[6] Classes are useful when you have, or possibly will have in the future, more than one element that shares the same style. An example may be a div of comments or a certain list style to use for related links. Additionally, a given element can have more than one class associated with it, while an element can only have one id.<br><br>URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12889362/what-is-the-difference-between-id-and-class-in-css-and-when-should-i-use-them<br><br>[7] Class and ID are selectors used to organize CSS code. ID describes something singular. Class describes something with multiple elements. While they work similarly, knowing when to use each can make your code cleaner. When creating a website, it is crucial to have a unified style throughout the page.<br><br>URL: https://www.bestcolleges.com/bootcamps/guides/css-class-vs-id/<br><br>[8] Id and class both are the CSS element selectors and are used to identify an element based on its assigned name. CSS id and class selectors are the most used selectors in CSS. During the use of selectors, sometimes there is confusion occurs between id and class.<br><br>URL: https://www.javatpoint.com/css-class-vs-id<br><br>[9] .class will affect elements matching value in class attribute. style by id will affect elements matching value in id attribute. it is recommended that you do not repeat ID value in elements, since that is suppose to be unique identifier of element on current page.

The fundamental difference between is that you can reuse a class on your page over and over, whereas an ID can be used once.

It has a maximum transmission distance of up to 10 meters, depending on the type of cable used. The length of the cable will determine the speed and quality of the data transfer, as well as its maximum distance.\n\nFor example, CAT5e cables can reach up to 100m in length with a PCIe 3.0 connection, while CAT6 cables can reach up to 55m in length. However, using such long cables may result in signal degradation due to attenuation and crosstalk interference, which could lead to data loss or errors during transmission. Therefore, it is recommended that shorter cables be used for optimal performance and reliability when using PCIe 3.0 connections over longer distances.\n\nIn addition, it is important to note that PCIe 3.0 also supports copper-based cables, such as USB Type C and Thunderbolt 3 cables.

Its ease of use and powerful capabilities make it an excellent choice for developers of all levels. One of the most useful features in Python is the dictionary, which allows developers to store key-value pairs in a data structure that can be easily accessed and manipulated. In this article, we\'ll take a closer look at dictionaries in Python and how they can be used with examples. Weâ€™ll also explore some common methods, dos and donâ€™ts when using dictionaries. \n\nDictionaries are incredibly powerful tools that allow us to store information in a way that\'s easy to access, manipulate, and update. They are especially useful when dealing with large amounts of data or complex data structures such as nested lists or objects. With a dictionary, you can quickly search for specific values or keys without having to loop through every element of the collection. Let\'s dive into what dictionaries are and how to use them! \n\nâ— What\'s a Dictionary In Python \n\nA dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of items where each item is stored as a key-value pair. The key is used to identify the associated value, which can be any type of object including strings, integers, floats, booleans, lists or even other dictionaries. Dictionaries are mutable objects meaning they can be changed after they have been created. \n\nUnlike other data structures such as lists or tuples which have an order associated with them (i.e., the first element is always at index 0) dictionaries do not have any inherent order; instead each item is stored based on its key value pairings. This makes them incredibly versatile and powerful tools that allow us to quickly access specific elements within our data structure without having to iterate over every item like we would with a list or tuple. \n\n\nâ— How to Define/Create a Dictionary in Python - detailed explanation and examples \n\n Creating a dictionary in Python is simple; all you need is two sets of curly braces {} containing key-value pairs separated by commas. Here\'s an example: \n\n my_dict = {\'key1\': \'value1\', \'key2\': \'value2\'} \n\n As you can see from this example, each item consists of two parts: the key (in this case â€˜key1â€™) followed by its associated value (in this case â€˜value1â€™). Itâ€™s important to note that both keys must be unique; if you try to add another item with the same key it will overwrite the existing one instead of creating a new entry with different values for both keys.  \n\n You can also create an empty dictionary by simply using two sets of curly braces {} without any items inside:\n\n my_empty_dict = {}  \n\n Once your dictionary has been created you can start adding elements using either dot notation (my_dict[â€˜key3â€™] = â€˜value3â€™) or square bracket notation (my_dict.[\'key3\'] = \'value3\'). Both are equally valid ways of adding items but itâ€™s important to remember that if you use dot notation then your keys must be strings while square bracket notation allows you to use any type as long as it follows proper syntax rules (e.g., integers must be written without quotation marks).  \n\n To demonstrate how these work letâ€™s add some more items to our original example: \n\n my_dict = {\'key1\': \'value1\', \'key2\': \'value2\', \'key3\': 3} \n\n As you can see we added another item using square bracket notation specifying an integer as our value instead of a string â€“ this works because integers don\'t need quotation marks when written in square bracket notation while strings do need them when written in dot notation (e.g., my_dict[\'key4\'] = \"string\" ).  \n\nâ— How to Add Elements to a Python Dictionary - detailed explanation and examples \nAdding elements into your dictionary is relatively straightforward; all you need is two sets of curly braces {} containing key-value pairs separated by commas just like when creating your original dictionary but now with additional entries added on top:  \n\n my_dict = {\'key1\': \'value1\', \'key2\': \'value2\', \'key3\': 3}  \n\nTo add another element simply specify its key followed by its associated value within these brackets:  \n\n my_dict[\'key4\'] = \"string\"    # Adding an element using dot notation \n my_dict.[\'key5\'] = 5         # Adding an element using square bracket notation   \n\nAs mentioned earlier if you try adding another entry with the same key it will override any existing values so make sure each entry has unique keys!  \n\n<div> Now let\'s look at how we can read elements from our newly populated dictionaryâ€¦<br></div><div>   \n</div>â— How to Read Elements from a Python Dictionary - detailed explanation and examples \nReading elements from your python dictionary is just as easy as writing them; all you need do is specify the desired key within square brackets [] following your variable name and voila! You have access to its associated value:    \n\n print(my_dict[\'Key4\']) # Outputs \"string\"   \n\n<div> If you try accessing an element that doesn\'t exist then python will throw up an error message telling us what went wrong â€“ this makes debugging much easier since we know exactly what needs fixing rather than having python return something unexpected!   													      </div><div><br></div><div>â— How to Update a Dictionary In Python - detailed explanation and examples  Updating elements within your python dictionary involves two steps; firstly specifying which element needs updating\n</div>D', 1, '2023-03-02', '18:34:35', '2023-03-02 15:32:01'),

At 1080p you can get some very noticeable graphical improvements in games like Cyberpunk 2077. It does falter a bit at higher resolutions, which isnâ€™t surprising given how taxing ray tracing can be for contemporary systems.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">On the same hand, the RTX 4090 absolutely knocks ray tracing out of the park. If youâ€™re looking for something that can handle 4K and ray tracing at the same time while maintaining playable framerates, itâ€™s well worth a look.

Honestly, with the performance of either the RTX 3080 or the RTX 4090, it is hard to imagine needing a second GPU to coax out more frames. SLI was a fairly inefficient means of gaining more performance when the technology behind GPUs was less refined. On a GTX 780, it made perfect sense, but with an RTX 4090, it would just be a waste.</span></p><p dir=\"ltr\" style=\"line-height:1.38;margin-top:12pt;margin-bottom:12pt;\"><span style=\"font-size:11pt;font-family:Arial;color:#000000;background-color:transparent;font-weight:400;font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;text-decoration:none;vertical-align:baseline;white-space:pre;white-space:pre-wrap;\">The dimensions of the RTX 4090 also come into play.

The jump in performance from Ampere to Ada might surprise you, and the pricing certainly will. <br>RTX 4090 vs. RTX 3080: Side-By-Side Comparison RTX 4090 vs. RTX 3080: Whatâ€™s the Difference?<br><br>If it isnâ€™t immediately apparent, the RTX 4090 thoroughly outclasses the RTX 3080 in all possible technical specifications. The RTX 4090 is the flagship card for Ada, so this comes as little surprise. The RTX 3080 isnâ€™t a slouch, however.<br>Performance<br><br>The RTX 4090 takes the lead quite ably when playing games. Performance is nearly double that of the RTX 3080 on 1080p resolution with a handful of popular games. Riotâ€™s first-person shooter Valorant sees the RTX 4090 at 895 frames per second versus the RTX 3080â€™s 509 frames per second. The ever-green Minecraft likewise sees astounding performance gains. The RTX 4090 runs popular game at 2367 frames per second, while the 3080 follows behind at 1490 frames per second.<br><br>During testing, both GPUs were tested on a test bench to eliminate any possible discrepancies. The RTX 4090 simply has more of everything. There are more CUDA cores, transistors, RAM, and any other possible factor you can think of present for it. This comes at the cost of a far steeper power draw. The RTX 4090 draws a substantial amount of power, with the TDP measuring in at 450 watts compared to the 320 watts of the 3080. This equates to needing a far more substantial power supply unit for the RTX 4090. Granted, if youâ€™re paying for a 4090, then an adequate power supply likely isnâ€™t an issue.<br>Pricing<br><br>Retail cost is where the RTX 3080 outclasses the RTX 4090. The higher-end Ampere GPU is readily available for under $1,000. Compare that to the astoundingly high cost of the RTX 4090 and it creates quite a gulf. The price-to-performance ratio of both GPUs heavily skews towards the RTX 3080 as well.<br><br>While the RTX 4090 is the pinnacle of performance currently available on the consumer market, it still has a suggested retail price of $1,599 compared to the $699 of the RTX 3080. Some smart shopping and deal hunting can net a cheaper 3080, but the prices on the 4090 are still sky-high thanks to a combination of limited stock and high demand.<br><br>If you donâ€™t mind waiting and keeping tabs on your favorite retailers, this is a moot point. If the cost is a concern, then the RTX 3080 takes an effortless lead.<br>AI Performance<br><br>Both of these GPUs make for ideal gaming GPUs. They thoroughly trounce things at 1080p, with popular games absolutely being crushed under their performance. There are plenty of other utilities for GPUs, however.<br><br>One popular usage is in machine learning and artificial intelligence. NVIDIA has long held the advantage for AI work, as their CUDA cores have become something of a standard for hardware-based parallel processing.<br><br>There is a multitude of ways to test GPUs for their viability in AI, and a popular benchmark is the Resnet50 utilizing FP16. The RTX 4090 scores an astonishingly high 1720 points. The very same test on the same test bench nets a result of 1022 points for the RTX 3080. As a tool for AI, the RTX 4090 actually comes off as quite affordable. Most major firms are going to be hiring off-site processing farms, but for lighter work for smaller firms, the RTX 4090 is a great choice. <br>RTX 4090 vs. RTX 3080: 6 Must-Know Facts<br><br>    The RTX 4090 is the fastest GPU on the market<br><br>    RTX 4090 is more power efficient than the RTX 3090<br><br>    The 4090 is a great entry-level AI GPU<br><br>    The RTX 3080 has great price-to-performance ration<br><br>    RTX 3080 readily handles VR and 4K gaming<br><br>    The RTX 3080 is very power efficient<br><br>RTX 4090 vs. RTX 3080: Which One is Better?

But what exactly is the difference between them? To help you understand this concept better, letâ€™s take a look at some of the key differences between amps and volts.\n\nItâ€™s easy to get confused between amps and volts â€“ after all, they both deal with electricity. But while they may seem similar on the surface, they are actually quite different. To put it in simple terms, volts measure how much energy is available in an electrical current while amps measure how much of that energy is being used. \n\nThink of it like this: if you were driving a car down a highway, then volts would be like the speed limit on that highway â€“ it tells you how fast you can go â€“ while amps would be like how many cars are on that highway â€“ it tells you how much traffic there is. \n\nAmps vs Volts: Side-by-Side Comparison \nâ€¢ Voltage (Volts): Measures potential energy \nâ€¢ Current (Amps): Measures actual flow of electric charge \nâ€¢ Voltage (Volts): Measured in Joules per Coulomb \nâ€¢ Current (Amps): Measured in Coulombs per second \nâ€¢ Voltage (Volts): Affects power output \nâ€¢ Current (Amps): Affects power consumption \nâ€¢ Voltage (Volts): Higher voltage means higher power output \nâ€¢ Current (Amps): Higher current means higher power consumption  \n\n Amps vs Volts: Whatâ€™s The Difference?\n\n Voltage (Volts) measures potential energy, which is essentially the amount of energy available in an electrical current. It is measured in Joules per Coulomb and affects power output - meaning that higher voltage will lead to higher power output. This makes sense when you think about it - if thereâ€™s more energy available in an electrical current, then more work can be done with it.\n\n On the other hand, current (amps) measures actual flow of electric charge. It is measured in Coulombs per second and affects power consumption - meaning that higher currents will lead to higher power consumption. This also makes sense - if thereâ€™s more electric charge flowing through a circuit then more work needs to be done to move that charge around which requires more energy.\n\n Amps vs Volts: 5 Must-Know Facts\n\n 1) Radio waves are made up of both amperes and volts - radio waves are actually made up of both amperes and volts working together to create electromagnetic radiation which can travel through space at the speed of light! This means that when we tune into our favorite radio station we are actually listening to a combination of amperes and volts!\n\n 2) Electric motors use both amperes and volts - electric motors use both amperes and volts together to generate mechanical force which can be used for things like powering machines or vehicles! This means that without both amperes AND volts our modern world as we know it wouldn\'t exist!\n\n 3) Signal modulation uses both amperes AND volts - signal modulation uses changes in amplitude (volts) as well as frequency (amps) to transmit information over long distances such as from one radio station to another or from one computer network node to another! This means that without signal modulation we wouldn\'t have access to things like radio broadcasts or internet access!\n\n 4) Electric shock occurs when too much voltage passes through your body - electric shock occurs when too much voltage passes through your body resulting in serious injury or even death! This means that even though low voltages don\'t cause any harm high voltages should always be handled with care!\n\n 5) Electric currents must obey Ohm\'s law - Ohm\'s law states that voltage equals current times resistance which basically means that for any given circuit there must always be a balance between amperage and voltage otherwise things won\'t work correctly! This means that if something isn\'t working correctly you should always check Ohm\'s law first before trying anything else!  \n\n Amps vs Volts: Which One Is Better? Which One Should You Use?\n\n When it comes down to deciding which one is better between amps or volts, there really isnâ€™t a clear answer as each has its own unique benefits depending on what kind of application you need them for. For example, if you need something with high power output then using high voltage would be your best bet whereas if you need something with low power consumption then using low current would be your best option. Ultimately it depends on what kind of application you need them for so make sure you do your research before making any decisions!  \n\n Amps vs Volts: Key Differences And Full Comparison FAQs \n\n 1) What is the difference between amps and volts? \nThe main difference between amps and volts is their respective units of measurement; amps measure electric charge whereas volts measure potential energy. In addition, high voltages result in higher levels of power output whereas high currents result in higher levels of power consumption.  \n\n 2) How do I calculate amp hours? \nTo calculate amp hours simply multiply the number of amps by the time period over which those amps were used; for example if 10A were used over 2 hours then 10A x 2h = 20Ah meaning 20 amp hours were used during this time period.  \n\n 3) How do I convert watts into amps? \nTo convert watts into\nAmps simply divide the number of watts by the voltage; for example  if you have 500 watts and 12 volts then 500W / 12V = 41.67A meaning that 41.67 amps are needed to produce 500 watts of power.\n\n 4) How do I calculate volts? \nTo calculate volts simply multiply the number of amps by the resistance; for example if you have 10 amps and a resistance of 5 ohms then 10A x 5Î© = 50V meaning that 50 volts are needed to produce 10 amps of current.  \n\n 5) What is Ohm\'s law? \nOhm\'s law states that voltage equals current times resistance which basically means that for any given circuit there must always be a balance between amperage and voltage otherwise things won\'t work correctly.  \n\n 6) How does signal modulation work? \nSignal modulation works by using changes in amplitude (volts) as well as frequency (amps) to transmit information over long distances such as from one radio station to another or from one computer network node to another. This process allows us to easily transfer data without having to physically move it!  \n\n 7) What is electric shock? \nElectric shock occurs when too much voltage passes through your body resulting in serious injury or even death! This means that even though low voltages don\'t cause any harm high voltages should always be handled with care!  \n\n 8) What is electromagnetism? \nElectromagnetism is the phenomenon whereby an electric current produces a magnetic', 2, '2023-03-08', '10:12:53', '2023-03-08 07:09:56'),

Whether youâ€™re a beginner or an experienced programmer, understanding and using percentage formulas will help you write more efficient code and make better decisions. In this article, weâ€™ll explore the different types of percentage formulas and how they can be used in real-life programming scenarios. \n\nThe Modulus Operator (%) \n\nThe modulus operator (%), also known as the remainder operator, is used to divide two numbers and return the remainder. For example, if we divide 10 by 3 using the modulus operator, the result would be 1 (10/3 = 3 with a remainder of 1). This can be useful for checking if a number is divisible by another number or not. It can also be used to check if two numbers are odd or even. \n\nCalculating Percentage Increase/Decrease \n\nWhen calculating the percentage increase or decrease between two numbers, we use the following formula: \n\nPercentage Change = ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) x 100 \n\nFor example, letâ€™s say that we want to calculate the percentage increase between 10 and 15. We would use the following calculation:  ((15 - 10) / 10) x 100 = 50%   This means that there was a 50% increase from 10 to 15. To implement this formula in programming, we could use a simple Python function like this:  \n\ndef calculate_percent_change(old_value, new_value):    return ((new_value - old_value) / old_value) * 100    print(calculate_percent_change(10, 15)) # prints 50%  \n\nCalculating Percentage of Total \n\nWhen calculating what percentage one number is of another number (also known as â€œpercentage of totalâ€), we use the following formula: Percentage Of Total = (Part / Whole) x 100 For example, letâ€™s say that we want to calculate what percentage 20 is of 80. We would use the following calculation: (20 / 80) x 100 = 25% This means that 20 is 25% of 80. To implement this formula in programming, we could use a simple Python function like this:   def calculate_percent_of_total(part, whole):    return (part / whole) * 100    print(calculate_percent_of_total(20, 80)) # prints 25%   Calculating Percentage Change When calculating the percentage change between two numbers, we use the following formula: Percentage Change = ((New Value - Old Value) / Average Of The Two Values ) x 100 For example, letâ€™s say that we want to calculate the percentage change between 10 and 15. We would use the following calculation: ((15 - 10) / 12.5 ) x 100 = 40% This means that there was a 40% change from 10 to 15. To implement this formula in programming, we could use a simple Python function like this:   def calculate_percentage_change(old_value , new value):    average = (old value + new value )/2     return ((new value - old value )/average)*100     print(calculate _percentage _change(10 ,15)) # prints 40 % Calculating Percentage Error When calculating percentage error between two values (also known as â€œerror rateâ€), we use the following formula: Error Rate = ((Actual Value - Expected Value)/Expected Value ) x 100 For example, letâ€™s say that our expected value was 10 but our actual value was 8; then our error rate would be calculated as follows: ((8-10)/10)*100=-20%. This means that our actual value was 20% lower than our expected value. To implement this formula in programming, we could use a simple Python function like this: def calculate _error _rate (expected , actual):    return((actual-expected)/expected)*100     print(calculate\n\n', 3, '2023-03-14', '10:21:48', '2023-03-14 07:18:25');

Final thoughts and additional resources\n\n \nHow To Install PIP On Windows (With Photos)\nInst alling Python packages can be a daunting task for many users. Fortunately, the Python Package Index (PIP) makes it easy to install and manage software written in Python. In this article, weâ€™ll show you how to install PIP on Windows and provide some troubleshooting tips for common installation errors.\n\nWhat is PIP? \n\nPIP stands for â€œPython Package Indexâ€ and is a package manager for the Python programming language. It allows users to easily download, install, upgrade, and uninstall packages written in the Python programming language. With PIP installed, users can quickly find and install packages from the online repository of over 200,000 packages. \n\nWhy Should You Install It? \n\nInstalling PIP makes it easier to manage your Python projects by allowing you to quickly access and install any package you need without having to manually search for them or download them from websites. Additionally, installing PIP ensures that you always have the latest version of any package you need so that your code runs smoothly and efficiently. \n\nReady to get started? Letâ€™s dive into how to install PIP on Windows! \n\nStep 1: Prerequisites for Installing PIP on Windows \n\nBefore you can start installing PIP on Windows, there are a few prerequisites that must be taken care of first: \n\n1.	You must have an up-to-date version of Python installed on your computer. If you havenâ€™t already done so, head over to python.org/downloads and download the installer for your operating system before continuing with this guide.  \n\n2.	You must have administrator privileges in order to run the installation script correctly â€“ if you donâ€™t have administrator privileges then please contact your system administrator before continuing with this guide.  \n&nbsp;\n<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Step 2: Verify Python Installation &nbsp;Once you have downloaded and installed Python onto your computer, it is important that you verify its installation before proceeding with installing PIP itself as incorrect installations may cause problems during the process or after installation has completed successfully. To do this open up Command Prompt (or Terminal if using MacOS) and type python --version â€“ if it returns a version number such as 3.7 then congratulations â€“ your installation was successful! If not then please go back through the steps above until it does return a version number before proceeding with the rest of this guide . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </div><div><br></div><div>Now that we\'ve verified our Python installation is working correctly let\'s move onto actually installing PIP itself! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </div><div><br></div><div>Major Step 3: Download PIP Installation Script&nbsp;The first step in installing PIP is downloading its installation script which we can do by visiting pypi.org/project/pip/. Once at this page click on \"Download\" which will take us directly to our downloads folder where we should see a file called get-pip .py - this is our installation script! &nbsp; &nbsp; </div><div><br></div><div>Major Step 4: Run The Installation Script&nbsp;Now that we\'ve downloaded our installation script let\'s\n</div>\nrun it! To do this open up Command Prompt (or Terminal if using Mac OS) and type python get-pip.py â€“ this will begin the installation process. If you are asked to confirm your administrator privileges press â€œYâ€ and then enter. \n\nMajor Step 5: Add PIP to Windows Environment Variables&nbsp;Once the installation process has completed successfully you will need to add PIP to your Windows environment variables so that it can be used in all of your projects. To do this open up the Control Panel, click on System and Security, then click on System, then Advanced system settings, then Environment Variables. In the window that appears select Path from the list of variables and click Edit. In the new window that appears press New and type in C:\\Python27\\Scripts\\;C:\\Python27\\Lib\\site-packages\\pip\\. Click OK twice to save your changes. \n\nTroubleshooting Tips \n\nCommon installation errors and how to fix them \nâ€¢	Error: â€œPermission deniedâ€ â€“ This error occurs when you donâ€™t have administrator privileges or if you havenâ€™t set up your environment variables correctly. Double check that you have administrator privileges before trying again or contact your system administrator for help setting up environment variables correctly. \nâ€¢	Error: â€œThe specified module could not be foundâ€ â€“ This error occurs when Python is not installed correctly or is out of date. Make sure that Python is installed correctly by verifying its version number in Command Prompt (or Terminal if using MacOS) as described above before trying again. \nâ€¢	Error: â€œNo matching distribution found for pipâ€ â€“ This error occurs when pip cannot find a valid version of Python on your computer. Make sure that Python is installed correctly by verifying its version number in Command Prompt (or Terminal if using MacOS) as described above before trying again. \n\nTips to ensure successful installation \nâ€¢	Make sure you have administrator privileges before starting the installation process as this will prevent any permission errors from occurring during the download or install process . \nâ€¢	Verify that Python is installed correctly by checking its version number in Command Prompt (or Terminal if using MacOS). \nâ€¢	Double check that any environment variables are set up correctly before proceeding with installation as incorrect setup can lead to problems down the road.  \nâ€¢	If you encounter any errors during installation make sure to read through them carefully and take note of any details they provide - these details can be invaluable when troubleshooting common issues!  \n\nConclusion\nPIP makes managing software written in Python much easier by allowing users to quickly access and install packages from an online repository of over 200,000 packages. In this article we covered how to install PIP on Windows step-by-step including photos after every click, common installation errors and tips for successful installations. Now it\'s time for you to try installing PIP yourself!

In this model, user devices communicate via a network with centrally located servers to get the data they need, instead of communicating with each other. End user devices such as laptops, smartphones, and desktop computers are considered to be \'clients\' of the servers, as if they were customers obtaining services from a company.

In contrast, DHCP server is a device that dynamically assigns IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network so that they can communicate with each other.<br><br>[2] DHCP is used to assign IP addresses to devices on a network, while DNS is used to translate domain names into IP addresses. In terms of how they are used, DHCP is typically used when a device first connects to a network, while DNS is used when a device requests a website.<br><br>[3] The architecture of DNS is given below: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP): Like DNS server, it does not map domain names into IP addresses or IP addresses into domain names, DHCP server is used to configures the hosts mechanically. Lets see the difference between DNS and DHCP: DHCP Full Form 0 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)<br><br>[4] DNS is used for resolving and recursively resolving the address to name or name to address of the host. On the other hand, DHCP is used for allocating the addresses to the host in the network dynamically or statically. DNS uses port number 53 whereas DHCP could either use 67 or 68.<br><br>[5] DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) supports the UDP protocol whereas DNS (Domain Name System) supports both the UDP and TCP protocol. DNS is a centralized system that works in a hierarchical manner to translate the domain name of a website like xyz.com into a numerical IP address like 87.77.199.132 and vice versa.<br><br>[6] DHCP uses a well-known UDP port number 67 for the DHCP server and the UDP port number 68 for the client. DNS (Domain Name System) DNS is a network protocol used to translate hostnames into IP addresses. DNS is not required to establish a network connection, but it is much more user friendly for human users than the numeric addressing scheme.<br><br>[7] A Domain Name System (DNS) server is used to translate domain names to IP Addresses and vice versa. DHCP is a client/server protocol that automatically assigns an IP address and other configuration information to an Internet Protocol (IP) host. Read through this article to find out more about DNS and DHCP and how they are different from each other.<br><br>[8] DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) and DNS (Domain Name System) both work across the client-server architecture though they are different terms. While DNS maps the name of the domain to the IP address, DHCP is a protocol that assigns the IP address to the host in a network either dynamically or statically.

With the rise of cyber-attacks, data breaches, and online fraud, itâ€™s more important than ever to stay informed about the different types of information security threats out there. Here are some of the most common threats you should be aware of: \n\nMalware, Ransomware, and Other Malicious Software: Malware is malicious software designed to damage or gain unauthorized access to a computer system. It can come in many forms including viruses, worms, Trojans, spyware, adware, and ransomware. Malware can be used to steal personal data or infect systems with ransomware which locks users out until they pay a ransom. \n\nInsider Threats: Insider threats are malicious attacks from people within an organization such as employees or contractors who have access to sensitive information. They can use their privileged access to steal data or disrupt operations. \n\nDenial of Service Attacks: Denial of service (DoS) attacks are when hackers flood a network with traffic in order to overwhelm it and prevent legitimate users from accessing it. DoS attacks can be used for extortion or simply as a way to disrupt operations. \n\nWebsite Redirects and Mirroring: Website redirects occur when someone visits a website but is automatically redirected to another website without their knowledge or consent. This can be used for malicious purposes such as phishing scams or malware distribution. Website mirroring is similar but instead of redirecting visitors it copies the content from one website and posts it on another website without authorization. \n\nBotnets: Botnets are networks of computers that have been infected with malicious software and are controlled by hackers remotely without the userâ€™s knowledge or consent. Botnets are often used for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks where multiple computers send requests simultaneously in order to overwhelm a target system. They can also be used for spamming campaigns or other malicious activities such as stealing personal information or spreading malware. \n\nMan in the Middle Attacks: Man in the middle (MITM) attacks occur when hackers intercept communications between two parties without either party knowing about it. The hacker can then use this intercepted data for malicious purposes such as stealing passwords or financial information. \n\nPhishing Scams: Phishing scams involve sending emails that appear legitimate but contain links that lead to malicious websites where users may be tricked into entering sensitive information such as passwords or credit card numbers which can then be stolen by hackers. \n\nSQL Injection Attacks: SQL injection attacks occur when attackers inject malicious code into an applicationâ€™s database in order to gain access to sensitive data stored there such as customer records or', 1, '2023-05-02', '14:54:44', '2023-05-02 11:54:44'),

You seem to know more about me than I do.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: If not you then 3/4 of your phone book did, standing beyond the fringes of the fray doesn\'t absolve you of paganistic festivals. It is quite in order to ask your girlfriend jingle bells all the way!</p><p><br></p><p>Mike: More like 9/10 actually which is more or less equal to the proportion of folks on this forum who did, but we can\'t all believe that the position of Alpha Centauri and the number of Jupiter\'s moons influences my personality and future without questioning how.</p><p><br></p><p>That statistic is interesting actually from a psycho-social point of view, if you dare employ the logical thinking you\'re trying to rebuff. It shows just how easy it is to imprint ideas on the minds of most folks. I\'d hate to be that susceptible to BS because I confound cause with coincidence.</p><p><br></p><p>Skepticism bore the world we\'re living in by adopting a serious, scholarly and scientific approach to hitherto \"supernatural\" or \"paranormal\" phenomena. That\'s why I\'d expect no less of myself, and anyone else for that matter especially in this century.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: On the contrary I seek not to rebuff logical construct, just an advocate for equality in the sense of a merger between the left and right spheres of the mind. Order precedes chaos and vice versa, this isn\'t BS but actual literature from a close circle of celebrated swiss Dr Carl Jung, I\'d be loathe to assume that the venerated psychology titan had as firm a grip on a serious scholarly and scientific approach to education as you.</p><p><br></p><p>Mike: Catch me dead trying to marry a school of thought that speaks of \"merging the left and right spheres of the mind\" with logic and science. It just sounds like a lazy, desperate effort to make your old, outdated beliefs sound more credible. Yours is a moot point if not an effort in futility my friend.</p><p><br></p><p>If your superstitions were presented in a more critical light, I wouldn\'t be so dismissive. There\'s simply no place for superstitions anymore. Anything put forward is subject to the rigors of scientific examination, no matter how venerable the source. Even the most respected figures can be wrong or have their own biases and limitations.</p><p><br></p><p>We\'ve actually made leaps and bounds since Jung put forward his propositions, and I\'m more than certain he would belong to a different school of thought today if he had the chance to enjoy convenient access to knowledge in this century like you.</p><p><br></p><p>He\'d probably laugh you out of town for steadfastly holding to archaic ways of thinking as if they were gospel.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: 1st paragraph of your reply belittles the written works of Dr Carl Jung absent an intent to inquire on the article I bring forth.</p><p><br></p><p>2nd paragraph denotes your preference for logic and the mistrust for archaic knowledge.</p><p><br></p><p>3rd and 4th are an arrogant preposition that serves to belittle scholars articles.</p><p><br></p><p>To that end I believe this back and forth is pointless, to each their own elder.</p><p><br></p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Yeah, you had to trivialize my response.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyway, I was simply pointing out the fact that it\'s time to move forward and discard outdated, illogical ways of thinking if they can\'t stand scientific scrutiny. You and I have the benefit of hindsight and the tools to scientifically examine concepts and hypotheses so why not be critical and discerning when it comes to accepting ideas, however dated?</p><p><br></p><p>Dr. Jung\'s work isn\'t exempt from critical examination so if the premise of his writings on finding a nexus between science and the metaphysical realm isn\'t convincing enough, how\'s it sensible to cling to them? After all alchemy, which he was a major proponent of is nothing but pseudoscience. I\'m not trying to take anything away from him.</p><p><br></p><p>If we don\'t question what these old disciplines teach, then we\'re perpetuating outdated, potentially harmful beliefs. I\'m inviting you, @kaynety, @SonOfTheSoil and co to be open-minded and welcome the habit of asking questions. Challenge assumptions and embrace empirical evidence. That\'s what science is all about.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: In the spirit of being open minded and asking questions, I have a final one. What is your scientific opinion on dreams? </p><p><br></p><p>Mike: I\'m no expert in neuroscience but the little I know is that dreams are an avenue for the human brain to consolidate memories and help in the problem-solving of complex thoughts. What does your camp have to say about them?</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: Plenty about the subconscious and it\'s mode of communication to the ego or the conscious mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Mike: Would that hold up to scientific scrutiny through such tools as neurochemistry? Would it be verifiable? Also, animals have been shown to dream, just like humans. Do animals have a subconscious ergo a conscious mind and ego?</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: I haven\'t had the time to inquire from the animals I own, however when you said dreams aid in complex problem solving how is that any different from your subconscious communicating to your conscious?</p><p><br></p><p>Mike: For starters, one is a process of the brain that is observable and measurable scientifically, while the other is still a matter of speculation. Neurochemistry has been used to map the brain\'s activities during sleep and interpret what the dreamer was experiencing. That lends a lot more credibility to my hypothesis than your yet-to-be-verified (and almost unverifiable) theories.</p><p><br></p><p>Also, do not confound wakefulness with consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: You seem knowledgeable in neurochemistry, so tell me more about this measurable tool, does it map out the brain activity to the point it displays the images in the dream?</p><p><br></p><p>Don\'t claim ownership over an already developed hypothesis!</p><p><br></p><p>Mike: LOL. Calm down. Maybe I should have said \"our\" hypothesis to mean we of rational thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>To your question on measurement, I am under no obligation to answer that as it neighbours the trivial and ridiculous.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: So you\'ve ran out of smart arse answers have you?</p><p><br></p><p>It\'s a simple question not a trivial nor ridiculous one as the whole point of dreams is the content which ought to entail both the material and the subjects reactions, so does the machine record the actual dreams or does it not?</p><p><br></p><p>Mike: Oh, I\'m sure I can come up with a few more smart-alecky answers.</p><p><br></p><p>But wait, no, I don\'t have to. Anyhow, to the best of my knowledge, it doesn\'t actually record a person\'s dreams. What it does is measure brain activity, eye movements and the like which provide clues and insights into the dreaming process. EEGs, for example, can measure electrical signals in the brain while PET scans measure blood flow in parts of the brain associated with dreaming. It\'s a work in progress and if you don\'t want to understand that, you\'re a moron.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, quit deflections and ask a sensible question.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: I already asked my question on the images and the short answer is no, it cannot!</p><p>The machine in all it\'s splendor does not record images experienced in the dream and that is what the good doctor and his peers attempted to interpret what the images, and more importantly their symbology attempt to communicate to the conscious mind.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, there\'s one common dream about soaring through the air, and upon the dreamers realization of flight, he/she tends to fall down no longer capable of the feat.</p><p><br></p><p>What does the ability of flight mean to the subject?</p><p><br></p><p>Why is he/she capable of realizing they can fly?</p><p><br></p><p>Why does he/she fall?</p><p><br></p><p>Each individual has their own psyche so dreams and more importantly their CONTENTS so each and every single dream is unique as well as the patterns within it.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole point is symbology, and symbols especially old ones have never been restrained by language, there have an deeper meaning, barely seen on the surface.</p><p><br></p><p>It\'s a new year oh rational one, include poetry in your life not insults!</p><p><br></p><p>Mike: LOL.</p><p>I\'m not even sure what you\'ve typed is poetic,</p><p>Neither am I sure it was a sarcastic dig or polemic,</p><p>Perhaps a frantic attempt to make the olden seem more charismatic,</p><p>But I\'m sure it was anything but epic or scientific,</p><p>And it\'s actually something I\'d expect from a manic schizophrenic.</p><p><br></p><p>I\'m serving you poetic insults in case it\'s not clear,</p><p>Because I\'m all for vawulence anytime of the year,</p><p>Now, you can keep dreaming up myths and theories,</p><p>But reality is what we need to make everything in life clear.</p><p><br></p><p>Your outdated beliefs over time have been reduced to shite,</p><p>So get your head out of your aㅤss, and open your eyes to the light.</p><p><br></p><p>By the way, your attempts at sarcasm are nothing but farce,</p><p>And your attempts at logic have been left in arrears,</p><p>The ancient symbols you cling to have no place in this age,</p><p>Your ancient thinking should be locked away in a cage,</p><p>No matter how hard you try to make it sound sage.</p><p><br></p><p>All said, your stubbornness is an affront to this century\'s logic,</p><p>Bukowski, Jung and Freud would agree,</p><p>That you should give up your ancient ways and be free,</p><p>And never again should you try to argue with me,</p><p>And never again should you try to be so iconic through poetry.</p><p><br></p><p>Back to the content of dreams, the general understanding is that flight usually symbolizes freedom and liberation, while falling down denotes a fear of failure or being overwhelmed. It can also represent a fear of success or a desire to be grounded.</p><p><br></p><p>While there are some common themes, as you mentioned, each dream is unique and can only be interpreted by the dreamer themselves. Symbols can represent a range of different things and often have multiple layers of meaning. Science has no explanation yet</p><p><br></p><p>The interpretation of the symbols in dreams can be subjective but as I said before, it should be open to critical examination and scientific inquiry and that\'s why I said it\'s a moot point trying to marry science and superstition. Superstition shouldn\'t begin where science is at a loss or yet to come up with an explanation. Logic should tell you so.</p><p><br></p><p>I\'m not sure how I got to writing rhyming poetry or why I even got down this rabbit hole with you.

That\'s what science is all about.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: In the spirit of being open minded and asking questions, I have a final one. What is your scientific opinion on dreams? </p><p><br></p><p>Mike: I\'m no expert in neuroscience but the little I know is that dreams are an avenue for the human brain to consolidate memories and help in the problem-solving of complex thoughts.

Would it be verifiable? Also, animals have been shown to dream, just like humans. Do animals have a subconscious ergo a conscious mind and ego?</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: I haven\'t had the time to inquire from the animals I own, however when you said dreams aid in complex problem solving how is that any different from your subconscious communicating to your conscious?</p><p><br></p><p>Mike: For starters, one is a process of the brain that is observable and measurable scientifically, while the other is still a matter of speculation. Neurochemistry has been used to map the brain\'s activities during sleep and interpret what the dreamer was experiencing. That lends a lot more credibility to my hypothesis than your yet-to-be-verified (and almost unverifiable) theories.</p><p><br></p><p>Also, do not confound wakefulness with consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: You seem knowledgeable in neurochemistry, so tell me more about this measurable tool, does it map out the brain activity to the point it displays the images in the dream?</p><p><br></p><p>Don\'t claim ownership over an already developed hypothesis!</p><p><br></p><p>Mike: LOL. Calm down. Maybe I should have said \"our\" hypothesis to mean we of rational thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>To your question on measurement, I am under no obligation to answer that as it neighbours the trivial and ridiculous.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: So you\'ve ran out of smart arse answers have you?</p><p><br></p><p>It\'s a simple question not a trivial nor ridiculous one as the whole point of dreams is the content which ought to entail both the material and the subjects reactions, so does the machine record the actual dreams or does it not?</p><p><br></p><p>Mike: Oh, I\'m sure I can come up with a few more smart-alecky answers.</p><p><br></p><p>But wait, no, I don\'t have to. Anyhow, to the best of my knowledge, it doesn\'t actually record a person\'s dreams. What it does is measure brain activity, eye movements and the like which provide clues and insights into the dreaming process. EEGs, for example, can measure electrical signals in the brain while PET scans measure blood flow in parts of the brain associated with dreaming. It\'s a work in progress and if you don\'t want to understand that, you\'re a moron.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, quit deflections and ask a sensible question.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: I already asked my question on the images and the short answer is no, it cannot!</p><p>The machine in all it\'s splendor does not record images experienced in the dream and that is what the good doctor and his peers attempted to interpret what the images, and more importantly their symbology attempt to communicate to the conscious mind.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, there\'s one common dream about soaring through the air, and upon the dreamers realization of flight, he/she tends to fall down no longer capable of the feat.</p><p><br></p><p>What does the ability of flight mean to the subject?</p><p><br></p><p>Why is he/she capable of realizing they can fly?</p><p><br></p><p>Why does he/she fall?</p><p><br></p><p>Each individual has their own psyche so dreams and more importantly their CONTENTS so each and every single dream is unique as well as the patterns within it.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole point is symbology, and symbols especially old ones have never been restrained by language, there have an deeper meaning, barely seen on the surface.</p><p><br></p><p>It\'s a new year oh rational one, include poetry in your life not insults!</p><p><br></p><p>Mike: LOL.</p><p>I\'m not even sure what you\'ve typed is poetic,</p><p>Neither am I sure it was a sarcastic dig or polemic,</p><p>Perhaps a frantic attempt to make the olden seem more charismatic,</p><p>But I\'m sure it was anything but epic or scientific,</p><p>And it\'s actually something I\'d expect from a manic schizophrenic.</p><p><br></p><p>I\'m serving you poetic insults in case it\'s not clear,</p><p>Because I\'m all for vawulence anytime of the year,</p><p>Now, you can keep dreaming up myths and theories,</p><p>But reality is what we need to make everything in life clear.</p><p><br></p><p>Your outdated beliefs over time have been reduced to shite,</p><p>So get your head out of your aㅤss, and open your eyes to the light.</p><p><br></p><p>By the way, your attempts at sarcasm are nothing but farce,</p><p>And your attempts at logic have been left in arrears,</p><p>The ancient symbols you cling to have no place in this age,</p><p>Your ancient thinking should be locked away in a cage,</p><p>No matter how hard you try to make it sound sage.</p><p><br></p><p>All said, your stubbornness is an affront to this century\'s logic,</p><p>Bukowski, Jung and Freud would agree,</p><p>That you should give up your ancient ways and be free,</p><p>And never again should you try to argue with me,</p><p>And never again should you try to be so iconic through poetry.</p><p><br></p><p>Back to the content of dreams, the general understanding is that flight usually symbolizes freedom and liberation, while falling down denotes a fear of failure or being overwhelmed. It can also represent a fear of success or a desire to be grounded.</p><p><br></p><p>While there are some common themes, as you mentioned, each dream is unique and can only be interpreted by the dreamer themselves. Symbols can represent a range of different things and often have multiple layers of meaning. Science has no explanation yet</p><p><br></p><p>The interpretation of the symbols in dreams can be subjective but as I said before, it should be open to critical examination and scientific inquiry and that\'s why I said it\'s a moot point trying to marry science and superstition. Superstition shouldn\'t begin where science is at a loss or yet to come up with an explanation. Logic should tell you so.</p><p><br></p><p>I\'m not sure how I got to writing rhyming poetry or why I even got down this rabbit hole with you. Nevertheless, I\'d like to remind you that my point is that if we don\'t critically examine what these old disciplines teach, we\'re just perpetuating archaic beliefs that have nothing to offer humanity besides wishful thinking and delusional solutions.</p><p><br></p><p>So if there\'s no new reasonable question, it\'s time to move on my friend.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: I actually did a paper last year, a Master, about neuromarketing.

Anyhow, to the best of my knowledge, it doesn\'t actually record a person\'s dreams. What it does is measure brain activity, eye movements and the like which provide clues and insights into the dreaming process. EEGs, for example, can measure electrical signals in the brain while PET scans measure blood flow in parts of the brain associated with dreaming. It\'s a work in progress and if you don\'t want to understand that, you\'re a moron.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, quit deflections and ask a sensible question.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: I already asked my question on the images and the short answer is no, it cannot!</p><p>The machine in all it\'s splendor does not record images experienced in the dream and that is what the good doctor and his peers attempted to interpret what the images, and more importantly their symbology attempt to communicate to the conscious mind.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, there\'s one common dream about soaring through the air, and upon the dreamers realization of flight, he/she tends to fall down no longer capable of the feat.</p><p><br></p><p>What does the ability of flight mean to the subject?</p><p><br></p><p>Why is he/she capable of realizing they can fly?</p><p><br></p><p>Why does he/she fall?</p><p><br></p><p>Each individual has their own psyche so dreams and more importantly their CONTENTS so each and every single dream is unique as well as the patterns within it.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole point is symbology, and symbols especially old ones have never been restrained by language, there have an deeper meaning, barely seen on the surface.</p><p><br></p><p>It\'s a new year oh rational one, include poetry in your life not insults!</p><p><br></p><p>Mike: LOL.</p><p>I\'m not even sure what you\'ve typed is poetic,</p><p>Neither am I sure it was a sarcastic dig or polemic,</p><p>Perhaps a frantic attempt to make the olden seem more charismatic,</p><p>But I\'m sure it was anything but epic or scientific,</p><p>And it\'s actually something I\'d expect from a manic schizophrenic.</p><p><br></p><p>I\'m serving you poetic insults in case it\'s not clear,</p><p>Because I\'m all for vawulence anytime of the year,</p><p>Now, you can keep dreaming up myths and theories,</p><p>But reality is what we need to make everything in life clear.</p><p><br></p><p>Your outdated beliefs over time have been reduced to shite,</p><p>So get your head out of your aㅤss, and open your eyes to the light.</p><p><br></p><p>By the way, your attempts at sarcasm are nothing but farce,</p><p>And your attempts at logic have been left in arrears,</p><p>The ancient symbols you cling to have no place in this age,</p><p>Your ancient thinking should be locked away in a cage,</p><p>No matter how hard you try to make it sound sage.</p><p><br></p><p>All said, your stubbornness is an affront to this century\'s logic,</p><p>Bukowski, Jung and Freud would agree,</p><p>That you should give up your ancient ways and be free,</p><p>And never again should you try to argue with me,</p><p>And never again should you try to be so iconic through poetry.</p><p><br></p><p>Back to the content of dreams, the general understanding is that flight usually symbolizes freedom and liberation, while falling down denotes a fear of failure or being overwhelmed. It can also represent a fear of success or a desire to be grounded.</p><p><br></p><p>While there are some common themes, as you mentioned, each dream is unique and can only be interpreted by the dreamer themselves. Symbols can represent a range of different things and often have multiple layers of meaning. Science has no explanation yet</p><p><br></p><p>The interpretation of the symbols in dreams can be subjective but as I said before, it should be open to critical examination and scientific inquiry and that\'s why I said it\'s a moot point trying to marry science and superstition.

Logic should tell you so.</p><p><br></p><p>I\'m not sure how I got to writing rhyming poetry or why I even got down this rabbit hole with you.

You seem to know more about me than I do.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: If not you then 3/4 of your phone book did, standing beyond the fringes of the fray doesn\'t absolve you of paganistic festivals. It is quite in order to ask your girlfriend jingle bells all the way!</p><p><br></p><p>Mike: More like 9/10 actually which is more or less equal to the proportion of folks on this forum who did, but we can\'t all believe that the position of Alpha Centauri and the number of Jupiter\'s moons influences my personality and future without questioning how.</p><p><br></p><p>That statistic is interesting actually from a psycho-social point of view, if you dare employ the logical thinking you\'re trying to rebuff. It shows just how easy it is to imprint ideas on the minds of most folks. I\'d hate to be that susceptible to BS because I confound cause with coincidence.</p><p><br></p><p>Skepticism bore the world we\'re living in by adopting a serious, scholarly and scientific approach to hitherto \"supernatural\" or \"paranormal\" phenomena. That\'s why I\'d expect no less of myself, and anyone else for that matter especially in this century.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: On the contrary I seek not to rebuff logical construct, just an advocate for equality in the sense of a merger between the left and right spheres of the mind. Order precedes chaos and vice versa, this isn\'t BS but actual literature from a close circle of celebrated swiss Dr Carl Jung, I\'d be loathe to assume that the venerated psychology titan had as firm a grip on a serious scholarly and scientific approach to education as you.</p><p><br></p><p>Mike: Catch me dead trying to marry a school of thought that speaks of \"merging the left and right spheres of the mind\" with logic and science. It just sounds like a lazy, desperate effort to make your old, outdated beliefs sound more credible. Yours is a moot point if not an effort in futility my friend.</p><p><br></p><p>If your superstitions were presented in a more critical light, I wouldn\'t be so dismissive. There\'s simply no place for superstitions anymore. Anything put forward is subject to the rigors of scientific examination, no matter how venerable the source. Even the most respected figures can be wrong or have their own biases and limitations.</p><p><br></p><p>We\'ve actually made leaps and bounds since Jung put forward his propositions, and I\'m more than certain he would belong to a different school of thought today if he had the chance to enjoy convenient access to knowledge in this century like you.</p><p><br></p><p>He\'d probably laugh you out of town for steadfastly holding to archaic ways of thinking as if they were gospel.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: 1st paragraph of your reply belittles the written works of Dr Carl Jung absent an intent to inquire on the article I bring forth.</p><p><br></p><p>2nd paragraph denotes your preference for logic and the mistrust for archaic knowledge.</p><p><br></p><p>3rd and 4th are an arrogant preposition that serves to belittle scholars articles.</p><p><br></p><p>To that end I believe this back and forth is pointless, to each their own elder.</p><p><br></p><p>Mike:&nbsp;Yeah, you had to trivialize my response.</p><p><br></p><p>Anyway, I was simply pointing out the fact that it\'s time to move forward and discard outdated, illogical ways of thinking if they can\'t stand scientific scrutiny. You and I have the benefit of hindsight and the tools to scientifically examine concepts and hypotheses so why not be critical and discerning when it comes to accepting ideas, however dated?</p><p><br></p><p>Dr. Jung\'s work isn\'t exempt from critical examination so if the premise of his writings on finding a nexus between science and the metaphysical realm isn\'t convincing enough, how\'s it sensible to cling to them? After all alchemy, which he was a major proponent of is nothing but pseudoscience.

That\'s what science is all about.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: In the spirit of being open minded and asking questions, I have a final one. What is your scientific opinion on dreams? </p><p><br></p><p>Mike: I\'m no expert in neuroscience but the little I know is that dreams are an avenue for the human brain to consolidate memories and help in the problem-solving of complex thoughts.

Calm down. Maybe I should have said \"our\" hypothesis to mean we of rational thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>To your question on measurement, I am under no obligation to answer that as it neighbours the trivial and ridiculous.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: So you\'ve ran out of smart arse answers have you?</p><p><br></p><p>It\'s a simple question not a trivial nor ridiculous one as the whole point of dreams is the content which ought to entail both the material and the subjects reactions, so does the machine record the actual dreams or does it not?</p><p><br></p><p>Mike: Oh, I\'m sure I can come up with a few more smart-alecky answers.</p><p><br></p><p>But wait, no, I don\'t have to. Anyhow, to the best of my knowledge, it doesn\'t actually record a person\'s dreams. What it does is measure brain activity, eye movements and the like which provide clues and insights into the dreaming process. EEGs, for example, can measure electrical signals in the brain while PET scans measure blood flow in parts of the brain associated with dreaming. It\'s a work in progress and if you don\'t want to understand that, you\'re a moron.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, quit deflections and ask a sensible question.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: I already asked my question on the images and the short answer is no, it cannot!</p><p>The machine in all it\'s splendor does not record images experienced in the dream and that is what the good doctor and his peers attempted to interpret what the images, and more importantly their symbology attempt to communicate to the conscious mind.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, there\'s one common dream about soaring through the air, and upon the dreamers realization of flight, he/she tends to fall down no longer capable of the feat.</p><p><br></p><p>What does the ability of flight mean to the subject?</p><p><br></p><p>Why is he/she capable of realizing they can fly?</p><p><br></p><p>Why does he/she fall?</p><p><br></p><p>Each individual has their own psyche so dreams and more importantly their CONTENTS so each and every single dream is unique as well as the patterns within it.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole point is symbology, and symbols especially old ones have never been restrained by language, there have an deeper meaning, barely seen on the surface.</p><p><br></p><p>It\'s a new year oh rational one, include poetry in your life not insults!</p><p><br></p><p>Mike: LOL.</p><p>I\'m not even sure what you\'ve typed is poetic,</p><p>Neither am I sure it was a sarcastic dig or polemic,</p><p>Perhaps a frantic attempt to make the olden seem more charismatic,</p><p>But I\'m sure it was anything but epic or scientific,</p><p>And it\'s actually something I\'d expect from a manic schizophrenic.</p><p><br></p><p>I\'m serving you poetic insults in case it\'s not clear,</p><p>Because I\'m all for vawulence anytime of the year,</p><p>Now, you can keep dreaming up myths and theories,</p><p>But reality is what we need to make everything in life clear.</p><p><br></p><p>Your outdated beliefs over time have been reduced to shite,</p><p>So get your head out of your aㅤss, and open your eyes to the light.</p><p><br></p><p>By the way, your attempts at sarcasm are nothing but farce,</p><p>And your attempts at logic have been left in arrears,</p><p>The ancient symbols you cling to have no place in this age,</p><p>Your ancient thinking should be locked away in a cage,</p><p>No matter how hard you try to make it sound sage.</p><p><br></p><p>All said, your stubbornness is an affront to this century\'s logic,</p><p>Bukowski, Jung and Freud would agree,</p><p>That you should give up your ancient ways and be free,</p><p>And never again should you try to argue with me,</p><p>And never again should you try to be so iconic through poetry.</p><p><br></p><p>Back to the content of dreams, the general understanding is that flight usually symbolizes freedom and liberation, while falling down denotes a fear of failure or being overwhelmed. It can also represent a fear of success or a desire to be grounded.</p><p><br></p><p>While there are some common themes, as you mentioned, each dream is unique and can only be interpreted by the dreamer themselves. Symbols can represent a range of different things and often have multiple layers of meaning. Science has no explanation yet</p><p><br></p><p>The interpretation of the symbols in dreams can be subjective but as I said before, it should be open to critical examination and scientific inquiry and that\'s why I said it\'s a moot point trying to marry science and superstition. Superstition shouldn\'t begin where science is at a loss or yet to come up with an explanation. Logic should tell you so.</p><p><br></p><p>I\'m not sure how I got to writing rhyming poetry or why I even got down this rabbit hole with you. Nevertheless, I\'d like to remind you that my point is that if we don\'t critically examine what these old disciplines teach, we\'re just perpetuating archaic beliefs that have nothing to offer humanity besides wishful thinking and delusional solutions.</p><p><br></p><p>So if there\'s no new reasonable question, it\'s time to move on my friend.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: I actually did a paper last year, a Master, about neuromarketing. It was, and it is, to my understanding that tools such as EEGs are specifically used to denote a person\'s interests, at least in the marketing context. The tool will measure an individual\'s brain activity when subjected to a specific phenomenon. I am struggling to understand how that applies to dreams and just how exactly researchers discern what was covered in the dream.</p><p><br></p><p>Mike:&nbsp;</p><p>EEGs can measure brain activity in sleep,</p><p>And link it to certain dream states however deep,</p><p>The idea behind that is emotions can be found,</p><p>Through brain activity, eye movements all around,</p><p>And contraction of facial muscles that abound.</p><p><br></p><p>They can\'t directly record the dream sequence,</p><p>But by asking subjects what was experienced,</p><p>Scientists can link it to brain measurements,</p><p>And infer the dream\'s nature from the facial expressions,</p><p><br></p><p>To you Brian resident of Githurai 44 I must say,</p><p>Be critical and ask questions to what people like Jung say,</p><p>Challenge assumptions and embrace empirical evidence,</p><p>So that you will be spared the shame of being naive</p><p><br></p><p>The interpretation of the dream\'s content,</p><p>And symbols is very subjective in intent,</p><p>Which makes it easy to be taken in by claims,</p><p>That are baseless and rooted in wishful thinking, not facts.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: And to you Mike I retort, that besides 44 actually being a pretty decent neighborhood to reside in, the patterns within the fields of the subconscious are abstract and thus can be considered a qualitative variable and not quantitative, and while gadgets and their flashy gizmos impressive as they are have yet to scan images therein.</p><p><br></p><p>Dr Jung laid down the premises of the contested by the um..shall we say rationalists, of the ego and the subconscious.

You seem to know more about me than I do.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJay: If not you then 3/4 of your phone book did, standing beyond the fringes of the fray doesn\'t absolve you of paganistic festivals. It is quite in order to ask your girlfriend jingle bells all the way!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMike: More like 9/10 actually which is more or less equal to the proportion of folks on this forum who did, but we can\'t all believe that the position of Alpha Centauri and the number of Jupiter\'s moons influences my personality and future without questioning how.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThat statistic is interesting actually from a psycho-social point of view, if you dare employ the logical thinking you\'re trying to rebuff. It shows just how easy it is to imprint ideas on the minds of most folks. I\'d hate to be that susceptible to BS because I confound cause with coincidence.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSkepticism bore the world we\'re living in by adopting a serious, scholarly and scientific approach to hitherto \"supernatural\" or \"paranormal\" phenomena. That\'s why I\'d expect no less of myself, and anyone else for that matter especially in this century.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJay: On the contrary I seek not to rebuff logical construct, just an advocate for equality in the sense of a merger between the left and right spheres of the mind. Order precedes chaos and vice versa, this isn\'t BS but actual literature from a close circle of celebrated swiss Dr Carl Jung, I\'d be loathe to assume that the venerated psychology titan had as firm a grip on a serious scholarly and scientific approach to education as you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMike: Catch me dead trying to marry a school of thought that speaks of \"merging the left and right spheres of the mind\" with logic and science. It just sounds like a lazy, desperate effort to make your old, outdated beliefs sound more credible. Yours is a moot point if not an effort in futility my friend.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf your superstitions were presented in a more critical light, I wouldn\'t be so dismissive. There\'s simply no place for superstitions anymore. Anything put forward is subject to the rigors of scientific examination, no matter how venerable the source. Even the most respected figures can be wrong or have their own biases and limitations.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWe\'ve actually made leaps and bounds since Jung put forward his propositions, and I\'m more than certain he would belong to a different school of thought today if he had the chance to enjoy convenient access to knowledge in this century like you.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nHe\'d probably laugh you out of town for steadfastly holding to archaic ways of thinking as if they were gospel.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJay: 1st paragraph of your reply belittles the written works of Dr Carl Jung absent an intent to inquire on the article I bring forth.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n2nd paragraph denotes your preference for logic and the mistrust for archaic knowledge.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n3rd and 4th are an arrogant preposition that serves to belittle scholars articles.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo that end I believe this back and forth is pointless, to each their own elder.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMike: Yeah, you had to trivialize my response.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnyway, I was simply pointing out the fact that it\'s time to move forward and discard outdated, illogical ways of thinking if they can\'t stand scientific scrutiny. You and I have the benefit of hindsight and the tools to scientifically examine concepts and hypotheses so why not be critical and discerning when it comes to accepting ideas, however dated?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDr. Jung\'s work isn\'t exempt from critical examination so if the premise of his writings on finding a nexus between science and the metaphysical realm isn\'t convincing enough, how\'s it sensible to cling to them? After all alchemy, which he was a major proponent of is nothing but pseudoscience. I\'m not trying to take anything away from him.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIf we don\'t question what these old disciplines teach, then we\'re perpetuating outdated, potentially harmful beliefs. I\'m inviting you, @kaynety, @SonOfTheSoil and co to be open-minded and welcome the habit of asking questions. Challenge assumptions and embrace empirical evidence. That\'s what science is all about.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJay: In the spirit of being open minded and asking questions, I have a final one. What is your scientific opinion on dreams?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMike: I\'m no expert in neuroscience but the little I know is that dreams are an avenue for the human brain to consolidate memories and help in the problem-solving of complex thoughts. What does your camp have to say about them?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJay: Plenty about the subconscious and it\'s mode of communication to the ego or the conscious mind.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMike: Would that hold up to scientific scrutiny through such tools as neurochemistry? Would it be verifiable? Also, animals have been shown to dream, just like humans. Do animals have a subconscious ergo a conscious mind and ego?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJay: I haven\'t had the time to inquire from the animals I own, however when you said dreams aid in complex problem solving how is that any different from your subconscious communicating to your conscious?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMike: For starters, one is a process of the brain that is observable and measurable scientifically, while the other is still a matter of speculation. Neurochemistry has been used to map the brain\'s activities during sleep and interpret what the dreamer was experiencing. That lends a lot more credibility to my hypothesis than your yet-to-be-verified (and almost unverifiable) theories.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlso, do not confound wakefulness with consciousness.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJay: You seem knowledgeable in neurochemistry, so tell me more about this measurable tool, does it map out the brain activity to the point it displays the images in the dream?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDon\'t claim ownership over an already developed hypothesis!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMike: LOL. Calm down. Maybe I should have said \"our\" hypothesis to mean we of rational thinking.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo your question on measurement, I am under no obligation to answer that as it neighbours the trivial and ridiculous.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJay: So you\'ve ran out of smart arse answers have you?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt\'s a simple question not a trivial nor ridiculous one as the whole point of dreams is the content which ought to entail both the material and the subjects reactions, so does the machine record the actual dreams or does it not?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMike: Oh, I\'m sure I can come up with a few more smart-alecky answers.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut wait, no, I don\'t have to. Anyhow, to the best of my knowledge, it doesn\'t actually record a person\'s dreams. What it does is measure brain activity, eye movements and the like which provide clues and insights into the dreaming process. EEGs, for example, can measure electrical signals in the brain while PET scans measure blood flow in parts of the brain associated with dreaming. It\'s a work in progress and if you don\'t want to understand that, you\'re a moron.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNow, quit deflections and ask a sensible question.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJay: I already asked my question on the images and the short answer is no, it cannot!\r\n\r\nThe machine in all it\'s splendor does not record images experienced in the dream and that is what the good doctor and his peers attempted to interpret what the images, and more importantly their symbology attempt to communicate to the conscious mind.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor example, there\'s one common dream about soaring through the air, and upon the dreamers realization of flight, he/she tends to fall down no longer capable of the feat.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat does the ability of flight mean to the subject?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhy is he/she capable of realizing they can fly?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhy does he/she fall?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEach individual has their own psyche so dreams and more importantly their CONTENTS so each and every single dream is unique as well as the patterns within it.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe whole point is symbology, and symbols especially old ones have never been restrained by language, there have an deeper meaning, barely seen on the surface.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt\'s a new year oh rational one, include poetry in your life not insults!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMike: LOL.\r\n\r\nI\'m not even sure what you\'ve typed is poetic,\r\n\r\nNeither am I sure it was a sarcastic dig or polemic,\r\n\r\nPerhaps a frantic attempt to make the olden seem more charismatic,\r\n\r\nBut I\'m sure it was anything but epic or scientific,\r\n\r\nAnd it\'s actually something I\'d expect from a manic schizophrenic.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI\'m serving you poetic insults in case it\'s not clear,\r\n\r\nBecause I\'m all for vawulence anytime of the year,\r\n\r\nNow, you can keep dreaming up myths and theories,\r\n\r\nBut reality is what we need to make everything in life clear.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYour outdated beliefs over time have been reduced to shite,\r\n\r\nSo get your head out of your aㅤss, and open your eyes to the light.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBy the way, your attempts at sarcasm are nothing but farce,\r\n\r\nAnd your attempts at logic have been left in arrears,\r\n\r\nThe ancient symbols you cling to have no place in this age,\r\n\r\nYour ancient thinking should be locked away in a cage,\r\n\r\nNo matter how hard you try to make it sound sage.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAll said, your stubbornness is an affront to this century\'s logic,\r\n\r\nBukowski, Jung and Freud would agree,\r\n\r\nThat you should give up your ancient ways and be free,\r\n\r\nAnd never again should you try to argue with me,\r\n\r\nAnd never again should you try to be so iconic through poetry.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBack to the content of dreams, the general understanding is that flight usually symbolizes freedom and liberation, while falling down denotes a fear of failure or being overwhelmed.

I\'m inviting you, @kaynety, @SonOfTheSoil and co to be open-minded and welcome the habit of asking questions. Challenge assumptions and embrace empirical evidence. That\'s what science is all about.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: In the spirit of being open minded and asking questions, I have a final one. What is your scientific opinion on dreams? </p><p><br></p><p>Mike: I\'m no expert in neuroscience but the little I know is that dreams are an avenue for the human brain to consolidate memories and help in the problem-solving of complex thoughts. What does your camp have to say about them?</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: Plenty about the subconscious and it\'s mode of communication to the ego or the conscious mind.</p><p><br></p><p>Mike: Would that hold up to scientific scrutiny through such tools as neurochemistry? Would it be verifiable? Also, animals have been shown to dream, just like humans. Do animals have a subconscious ergo a conscious mind and ego?</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: I haven\'t had the time to inquire from the animals I own, however when you said dreams aid in complex problem solving how is that any different from your subconscious communicating to your conscious?</p><p><br></p><p>Mike: For starters, one is a process of the brain that is observable and measurable scientifically, while the other is still a matter of speculation. Neurochemistry has been used to map the brain\'s activities during sleep and interpret what the dreamer was experiencing. That lends a lot more credibility to my hypothesis than your yet-to-be-verified (and almost unverifiable) theories.</p><p><br></p><p>Also, do not confound wakefulness with consciousness.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: You seem knowledgeable in neurochemistry, so tell me more about this measurable tool, does it map out the brain activity to the point it displays the images in the dream?</p><p><br></p><p>Don\'t claim ownership over an already developed hypothesis!</p><p><br></p><p>Mike: LOL. Calm down. Maybe I should have said \"our\" hypothesis to mean we of rational thinking.</p><p><br></p><p>To your question on measurement, I am under no obligation to answer that as it neighbours the trivial and ridiculous.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: So you\'ve ran out of smart arse answers have you?</p><p><br></p><p>It\'s a simple question not a trivial nor ridiculous one as the whole point of dreams is the content which ought to entail both the material and the subjects reactions, so does the machine record the actual dreams or does it not?</p><p><br></p><p>Mike: Oh, I\'m sure I can come up with a few more smart-alecky answers.</p><p><br></p><p>But wait, no, I don\'t have to. Anyhow, to the best of my knowledge, it doesn\'t actually record a person\'s dreams. What it does is measure brain activity, eye movements and the like which provide clues and insights into the dreaming process. EEGs, for example, can measure electrical signals in the brain while PET scans measure blood flow in parts of the brain associated with dreaming. It\'s a work in progress and if you don\'t want to understand that, you\'re a moron.</p><p><br></p><p>Now, quit deflections and ask a sensible question.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: I already asked my question on the images and the short answer is no, it cannot!</p><p>The machine in all it\'s splendor does not record images experienced in the dream and that is what the good doctor and his peers attempted to interpret what the images, and more importantly their symbology attempt to communicate to the conscious mind.</p><p><br></p><p>For example, there\'s one common dream about soaring through the air, and upon the dreamers realization of flight, he/she tends to fall down no longer capable of the feat.</p><p><br></p><p>What does the ability of flight mean to the subject?</p><p><br></p><p>Why is he/she capable of realizing they can fly?</p><p><br></p><p>Why does he/she fall?</p><p><br></p><p>Each individual has their own psyche so dreams and more importantly their CONTENTS so each and every single dream is unique as well as the patterns within it.</p><p><br></p><p>The whole point is symbology, and symbols especially old ones have never been restrained by language, there have an deeper meaning, barely seen on the surface.</p><p><br></p><p>It\'s a new year oh rational one, include poetry in your life not insults!</p><p><br></p><p>Mike: LOL.</p><p>I\'m not even sure what you\'ve typed is poetic,</p><p>Neither am I sure it was a sarcastic dig or polemic,</p><p>Perhaps a frantic attempt to make the olden seem more charismatic,</p><p>But I\'m sure it was anything but epic or scientific,</p><p>And it\'s actually something I\'d expect from a manic schizophrenic.</p><p><br></p><p>I\'m serving you poetic insults in case it\'s not clear,</p><p>Because I\'m all for vawulence anytime of the year,</p><p>Now, you can keep dreaming up myths and theories,</p><p>But reality is what we need to make everything in life clear.</p><p><br></p><p>Your outdated beliefs over time have been reduced to shite,</p><p>So get your head out of your aㅤss, and open your eyes to the light.</p><p><br></p><p>By the way, your attempts at sarcasm are nothing but farce,</p><p>And your attempts at logic have been left in arrears,</p><p>The ancient symbols you cling to have no place in this age,</p><p>Your ancient thinking should be locked away in a cage,</p><p>No matter how hard you try to make it sound sage.</p><p><br></p><p>All said, your stubbornness is an affront to this century\'s logic,</p><p>Bukowski, Jung and Freud would agree,</p><p>That you should give up your ancient ways and be free,</p><p>And never again should you try to argue with me,</p><p>And never again should you try to be so iconic through poetry.</p><p><br></p><p>Back to the content of dreams, the general understanding is that flight usually symbolizes freedom and liberation, while falling down denotes a fear of failure or being overwhelmed. It can also represent a fear of success or a desire to be grounded.</p><p><br></p><p>While there are some common themes, as you mentioned, each dream is unique and can only be interpreted by the dreamer themselves. Symbols can represent a range of different things and often have multiple layers of meaning. Science has no explanation yet</p><p><br></p><p>The interpretation of the symbols in dreams can be subjective but as I said before, it should be open to critical examination and scientific inquiry and that\'s why I said it\'s a moot point trying to marry science and superstition. Superstition shouldn\'t begin where science is at a loss or yet to come up with an explanation. Logic should tell you so.</p><p><br></p><p>I\'m not sure how I got to writing rhyming poetry or why I even got down this rabbit hole with you. Nevertheless, I\'d like to remind you that my point is that if we don\'t critically examine what these old disciplines teach, we\'re just perpetuating archaic beliefs that have nothing to offer humanity besides wishful thinking and delusional solutions.</p><p><br></p><p>So if there\'s no new reasonable question, it\'s time to move on my friend.</p><p><br></p><p>Jay: I actually did a paper last year, a Master, about neuromarketing. It was, and it is, to my understanding that tools such as EEGs are specifically used to denote a person\'s interests, at least in the marketing context.

What is your scientific opinion on dreams?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMike: I\'m no expert in neuroscience but the little I know is that dreams are an avenue for the human brain to consolidate memories and help in the problem-solving of complex thoughts. What does your camp have to say about them?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJay: Plenty about the subconscious and it\'s mode of communication to the ego or the conscious mind.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMike: Would that hold up to scientific scrutiny through such tools as neurochemistry? Would it be verifiable? Also, animals have been shown to dream, just like humans. Do animals have a subconscious ergo a conscious mind and ego?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJay: I haven\'t had the time to inquire from the animals I own, however when you said dreams aid in complex problem solving how is that any different from your subconscious communicating to your conscious?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMike: For starters, one is a process of the brain that is observable and measurable scientifically, while the other is still a matter of speculation. Neurochemistry has been used to map the brain\'s activities during sleep and interpret what the dreamer was experiencing. That lends a lot more credibility to my hypothesis than your yet-to-be-verified (and almost unverifiable) theories.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAlso, do not confound wakefulness with consciousness.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJay: You seem knowledgeable in neurochemistry, so tell me more about this measurable tool, does it map out the brain activity to the point it displays the images in the dream?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDon\'t claim ownership over an already developed hypothesis!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMike: LOL. Calm down. Maybe I should have said \"our\" hypothesis to mean we of rational thinking.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo your question on measurement, I am under no obligation to answer that as it neighbours the trivial and ridiculous.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJay: So you\'ve ran out of smart arse answers have you?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt\'s a simple question not a trivial nor ridiculous one as the whole point of dreams is the content which ought to entail both the material and the subjects reactions, so does the machine record the actual dreams or does it not?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMike: Oh, I\'m sure I can come up with a few more smart-alecky answers.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBut wait, no, I don\'t have to. Anyhow, to the best of my knowledge, it doesn\'t actually record a person\'s dreams. What it does is measure brain activity, eye movements and the like which provide clues and insights into the dreaming process. EEGs, for example, can measure electrical signals in the brain while PET scans measure blood flow in parts of the brain associated with dreaming. It\'s a work in progress and if you don\'t want to understand that, you\'re a moron.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nNow, quit deflections and ask a sensible question.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJay: I already asked my question on the images and the short answer is no, it cannot!\r\n\r\nThe machine in all it\'s splendor does not record images experienced in the dream and that is what the good doctor and his peers attempted to interpret what the images, and more importantly their symbology attempt to communicate to the conscious mind.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nFor example, there\'s one common dream about soaring through the air, and upon the dreamers realization of flight, he/she tends to fall down no longer capable of the feat.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat does the ability of flight mean to the subject?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhy is he/she capable of realizing they can fly?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhy does he/she fall?\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEach individual has their own psyche so dreams and more importantly their CONTENTS so each and every single dream is unique as well as the patterns within it.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe whole point is symbology, and symbols especially old ones have never been restrained by language, there have an deeper meaning, barely seen on the surface.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIt\'s a new year oh rational one, include poetry in your life not insults!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMike: LOL.\r\n\r\nI\'m not even sure what you\'ve typed is poetic,\r\n\r\nNeither am I sure it was a sarcastic dig or polemic,\r\n\r\nPerhaps a frantic attempt to make the olden seem more charismatic,\r\n\r\nBut I\'m sure it was anything but epic or scientific,\r\n\r\nAnd it\'s actually something I\'d expect from a manic schizophrenic.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI\'m serving you poetic insults in case it\'s not clear,\r\n\r\nBecause I\'m all for vawulence anytime of the year,\r\n\r\nNow, you can keep dreaming up myths and theories,\r\n\r\nBut reality is what we need to make everything in life clear.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYour outdated beliefs over time have been reduced to shite,\r\n\r\nSo get your head out of your aㅤss, and open your eyes to the light.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBy the way, your attempts at sarcasm are nothing but farce,\r\n\r\nAnd your attempts at logic have been left in arrears,\r\n\r\nThe ancient symbols you cling to have no place in this age,\r\n\r\nYour ancient thinking should be locked away in a cage,\r\n\r\nNo matter how hard you try to make it sound sage.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAll said, your stubbornness is an affront to this century\'s logic,\r\n\r\nBukowski, Jung and Freud would agree,\r\n\r\nThat you should give up your ancient ways and be free,\r\n\r\nAnd never again should you try to argue with me,\r\n\r\nAnd never again should you try to be so iconic through poetry.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nBack to the content of dreams, the general understanding is that flight usually symbolizes freedom and liberation, while falling down denotes a fear of failure or being overwhelmed. It can also represent a fear of success or a desire to be grounded.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhile there are some common themes, as you mentioned, each dream is unique and can only be interpreted by the dreamer themselves. Symbols can represent a range of different things and often have multiple layers of meaning. Science has no explanation yet\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of the symbols in dreams can be subjective but as I said before, it should be open to critical examination and scientific inquiry and that\'s why I said it\'s a moot point trying to marry science and superstition. Superstition shouldn\'t begin where science is at a loss or yet to come up with an explanation. Logic should tell you so.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI\'m not sure how I got to writing rhyming poetry or why I even got down this rabbit hole with you. Nevertheless, I\'d like to remind you that my point is that if we don\'t critically examine what these old disciplines teach, we\'re just perpetuating archaic beliefs that have nothing to offer humanity besides wishful thinking and delusional solutions.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSo if there\'s no new reasonable question, it\'s time to move on my friend.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJay: I actually did a paper last year, a Master, about neuromarketing. It was, and it is, to my understanding that tools such as EEGs are specifically used to denote a person\'s interests, at least in the marketing context. The tool will measure an individual\'s brain activity when subjected to a specific phenomenon. I am struggling to understand how that applies to dreams and just how exactly researchers discern what was covered in the dream.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMike:\r\n\r\nEEGs can measure brain activity in sleep,\r\n\r\nAnd link it to certain dream states however deep,\r\n\r\nThe idea behind that is emotions can be found,\r\n\r\nThrough brain activity, eye movements all around,\r\n\r\nAnd contraction of facial muscles that abound.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThey can\'t directly record the dream sequence,\r\n\r\nBut by asking subjects what was experienced,\r\n\r\nScientists can link it to brain measurements,\r\n\r\nAnd infer the dream\'s nature from the facial expressions,\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nTo you Brian resident of Githurai 44 I must say,\r\n\r\nBe critical and ask questions to what people like Jung say,\r\n\r\nChallenge assumptions and embrace empirical evidence,\r\n\r\nSo that you will be spared the shame of being naive\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of the dream\'s content,\r\n\r\nAnd symbols is very subjective in intent,\r\n\r\nWhich makes it easy to be taken in by claims,\r\n\r\nThat are baseless and rooted in wishful thinking, not facts.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJay: And to you Mike I retort, that besides 44 actually being a pretty decent neighborhood to reside in, the patterns within the fields of the subconscious are abstract and thus can be considered a qualitative variable and not quantitative, and while gadgets and their flashy gizmos impressive as they are have yet to scan images therein.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nDr Jung laid down the premises of the contested by the um..shall we say rationalists, of the ego and the subconscious. This has brought about in occultic leaning cartoons the aspect of a protagonist whilst in a dilemma and angel popping on one shoulder advising caution while a devil popping on the other advising throwing caution to the wind, countless series bear the same blueprint of a holy vs a rubble rousing friend and this is by design.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs far as naivety goes, it takes a special sort of stupid for a man to discard knowledge in the name of being archaic and outdated, while better men than you have sought to consolidate the importance of symbolism in this modern world.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI gave an example of the Qatari world cup insignia bearing the resemblance of Ourubus, a snake devouring it\'s own tail.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAnother I\'ll provide is primitive tribes preference to exemplify a virtue by an animal, Kings in Africa preferring lions and leopard skins, Kings in Europe preference for Wolf and bear fur, stone age paintings of animals found deep in caves, Ancient Egyptians with Seth..and tons more.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nUnlike you I don\'t pout my bony chest out and proclaim that certain works of esteemed mind are nonsense nor hoist my skirts up and turn my nose on knowledge because it predates the first time I burst a nut.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nI intend to dedicate a huge chunk of 2023 to study subjective symbols, and if that earns me shame of naivety then so be it, society as is stands currently is full of sh\'t anyway.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMike:\r\n\r\nWhen you put words in my mouth like that,\r\n\r\nit takes to reason that you be taken to task,\r\n\r\nFor I never said that Jung\'s works were nonsense,\r\n\r\nonly that they should be subjected to rigors of modern science.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYour type have the tendency to see shadows in the dark,\r\n\r\nwhen the light of logic and reason can illuminate your heart,\r\n\r\nYour case in point of the Qatar insignia,\r\n\r\nis no proof that superstition should not be questioned,\r\n\r\nAs for stone age paintings and ancient Egyptians,\r\n\r\nThey are part of history,\r\n\r\nnot the present day equation.\r\n\r\nCause and coincidence are not to be confounded,\r\n\r\nAnd I\'m afraid your approach precludes further discourse along that course.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of symbols depends on the individual,\r\n\r\nWhich is why it\'s imperative to be critical and question them in a scientific way,\r\n\r\nSo that the truth is revealed and not what we want to hear.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nSymbols have their place in the modern world,\r\n\r\nBut the interpretation must be able to be unfurled,\r\n\r\nIt\'s no longer acceptable to take them at face value,\r\n\r\nWe must be critical and question, that\'s the rational we must solve.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAs for naivety, it takes a special kind of irrational boldness,\r\n\r\nTo cling to superstition and ignore scientific evidence,\r\n\r\nWithout questioning the validity of its source,\r\n\r\nAnd calling it a day without any recourse.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYou\'re something of a clod,\r\n\r\nIf you don\'t have the courage to be critical of what these old disciplines teach,\r\n\r\nDo not be ashamed of your naivety,\r\n\r\nBut instead strive for veritable knowledge that\'s rooted in logic!\r\n\r\nSo, when it comes to ancient ways of thinking,\r\n\r\nDon\'t be afraid to challenge assumptions,\r\n\r\nAnd embrace empirical evidence for solutions.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nOtherwise, if dedicating time to studying symbols is what you choose,\r\n\r\nI\'d suggest you arm yourself with knowledge and facts,\r\n\r\nAnd be open to critical examination and scientific inquiry.\r\n\r\nSo don\'t be afraid to ask questions,\r\n\r\nAnd use science to prove the assertions,\r\n\r\nFor the future is here, and it\'s time to move on.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nYour a priori argument is a fallacy, if not a fallacy of logic,\r\n\r\nSo it\'s time to break away from symbols and mythic,\r\n\r\nAnd embrace the modern world with its science and logic,\r\n\r\nAnd leave the old ways behind, where they belong,\r\n\r\nIn the realm of myth and superstition,\r\n\r\nNow, where do I claim compensation for bearing your incoherent retort?\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"ql-clipboard\" tabindex=\"-1\" contenteditable=\"true\"></div>\r\n<div class=\"ql-tooltip ql-hidden\"><input type=\"text\" data-formula=\"e=mc^2\" data-link=\"https://quilljs.com\" data-video=\"Embed URL\" /></div>', 'Symbology, numerology, astrology, metaphysics', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '48-revision-v1', '', '', '2023-01-04 09:18:46', '2023-01-04 09:18:46', '', 48, 'http://localhost/parrot/blog/?p=50', 0, 'revision', '', 0);
